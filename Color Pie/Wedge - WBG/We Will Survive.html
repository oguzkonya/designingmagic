            <p>Welcome to Abzan Week! This week, we'll be talking about the
              White-Black-Green wedge. For this and the following four clan theme
              weeks (which will be happening over a number of months), I thought I'd
              take yet another look at the colors and how they interact with one
              another. You can go to my <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/features.aspx?tag=color%20pie"
                target="_blank">color pie page</a>,
              which has my articles on single-color philosophy, two different sets of
              articles on two-color pairs, and my cycle of articles from the shard
              theme weeks. In addition, there are a few other articles where I talk
              color pie.</p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/abzan-notext-coloredmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>In the past, I've examined the colors from many different vantage
              points, even doing a series where I interviewed each one. For the wedge
              theme weeks, I was interested in exploring how the colors relate to one
              another, so for each theme week, I'm going to get the relevant three
              colors in a room together and interview them as a group. My goal with
              this series is to ask a few questions and then get out of the way as the
              colors talk among themselves.</p>

            <p>I hope this sounds like fun, so let's get started:</p>

            <p><strong>Hello. I would like to start by having each of you introduce
                yourselves. Let's go in the order that you all appear in the mana costs
                on Abzan cards.</strong></p>



            <p>Hello, I'm White. I'm the center of the Abzan wedge. I'm all about achieving peace through structure.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm Black. I'm the color paired up with its two enemies in this
              wedge, so you know that's a lot of fun. I'm all about achieving power
              through opportunity.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm Green. I'm all about achieving acceptance through wisdom. Don't
              worry, few people understand what that means. I'll explain it today.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Why don't we begin by talking a little bit about the aspect that this wedge portrays. How do each of you
              feel about endurance?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You can call it endurance. I call it survival. What's the number one goal for any individual? Don't let
              yourself get killed.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I think we're supposed to go in order.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>According to whom? He said to introduce yourself in order. I did. He
              never said anything about the rest of the interview. In fact, if you
              read his introduction he said he was going to "get out of the way as the
              colors talk among themselves." That's what we're doing.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>This entire interview would be much more orderly if we followed a set structure.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I don't care if it's orderly. In fact, if me talking "out of turn" makes you uncomfortable, I consider
              that an upside.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>There's no reason that we can't be civil. We are all working together as a wedge after all.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm in the wedge for my reasons, not yours. I want to survive. I team
              up with you two because you're the best two other colors at doing that.
              Nothing more.</p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'll take that as a compliment. Thank you.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That's not a compliment. I mean...it is technically, but I didn't
              mean it as one. Look, this wedge is all about surviving through the
              early and midgame to dominate in the endgame. That's a strategy I can
              get behind.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You and I have had our differences, but at least you understand the importance of long term planning.
              Red drives me nuts.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You also seem to understand the importance of sacrifice. You have
              this stupid tendency to lean toward self-sacrifice, but you do get that,
              sometimes, to win the long game, you have to give things up during the
              short game.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's all connected. The tiny seed and the mighty oak are just two ends of the same spectrum.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I never have any idea what you're saying.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>There is no short game and long game. There is just one continuous game that constantly evolves.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You talking isn't helping to make you any more understandable.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I think what Green is trying to say is that part of enduring is
              understanding at every level what your ultimate goal is. Soldiers lay
              down their lives because they understand what it does for the army.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We oddly agree here except for the part where you let the soldiers
              know they're going to die. Things go much more smoothly when those who
              need to be sacrificed aren't made aware of the fact. It cuts way down on
              them deviating from the plan.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/cardart_abzanbattlepriest.jpg"></p>

            <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Battle+Priest" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Abzan+Battle+Priest">Abzan

                target="_blank">Chris Rahn</a></p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That's because you never bother to share with those who work for you
              what the greater plan is. Perhaps if you could get them invested in what
              you're up to, then they might work together as a team. But wait, that's
              right, you don't care about them. They're just pawns.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Stop acting all high and mighty. You use pawns too. You just spend a
              lot of time and energy making them think the sacrifice was their idea.
              To give credit where credit is due, that's impressive. I have trouble
              getting my pawns to march to their own death, so props for that.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I like to think of it a little differently. With growth comes
              strength. If you can allow time to let things grow, they will grow
              stronger.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That which survives is stronger for the experience.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Tomato, tomahto.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I think the common ground for the three of us is that we each, in our
              own way, understand the need to endure. There is a cost that comes from
              prioritizing the future and the three of us are willing to pay those
              costs, some obviously a bit more distastefully than others.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>This again? You're all about the cycle of life and death. I don't get
              why using death isn't part of the "natural order." A cheetah attacks
              and kills a gazelle for a meal and that's "natural." A person kills
              another person in order to steal food to not starve and that's
              "unnatural." You're just being inconsistent.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>If you cannot see the difference between hunting and cold-blooded
              murder, there's not much I can say to sway you. Death is a natural
              process. My issue is when you use it as a weapon to warp nature.</p>



            <p>Why don't we talk a little about what mechanical resources you three have that helps you endure?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Well, the three of us tend to have the highest combined toughness.
              Black and I because we have more cards with a high toughness-to-power
              ratio and Green because it just has larger creatures that naturally have
              a high toughness.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/cardart_dazzlingramparts.jpg"></p>

                target="_blank">Jung Park</a></p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>White and I are the two colors that have vigilance, which is a
              defensive creature keyword mechanic. Black and I both have regeneration,
              which can also be defensive, although Black often uses it more
              offensively.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Green, White, and I are the three colors most likely to bring things
              back from the graveyard, both to the hand and onto the battlefield.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We're also the three colors most likely to gain life. Green and I even manage to do it without hurting
              anyone.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>White and I both have good creature removal. Green has fight effects, I guess, but other than that, it
              kind of sucks at it.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>My answer is: I block with the larger creature.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The one I just killed with my creature removal?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The other similarity is that we each have a style of play that allows
              us to gum up the board, preventing the opponent from killing us. How we
              each do it, though, is different. I'm about being proactive and playing
              cards that cut the opponent off from having viable win strategies. I
              set rules and create defenses that can make it very hard to defeat me.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I take a more direct approach: I kill every threat I can. Those that I
              can't kill on the battlefield, I try to remove before they even get
              cast. The key is to focus all my energies on removing threats and
              waiting to go for the kill until I've addressed them all.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>My strategy is to grow my mana faster than my opponents, speeding up
              the threats I can cast. Growing at a rate quicker than my opponents
              allows me to slowly overwhelm them.</p>



            <p>So is it odd being in a wedge where one of you is the enemy of the other two?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's not as if the shards didn't have a little of this. Black and I
              were in Esper together, and Black and Green were both in Jund. The only
              difference was that each of us had one shard where we didn't have to
              deal with either of our enemies. That just isn't true in the wedges.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I've come to a place where I've realized that we are ultimately
              defined by those around us, so part of what makes us who we are as
              colors comes from the fact that our enemies exist. I'm not fond of Black
              but, at least in the larger picture, I understand why Black exists.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Now I'll give you the real answer. Yes, it sucks. Especially for me.
              I've have no allies in this wedge. Zero. Do you have any idea how
              painful it is to have to listen to these two talk to each other. "Isn't
              the group wonderful? Isn't it just so fantastic that we constantly make
              poor choices prioritizing the weak over the strong?"</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Prioritizing the group is putting strength over weakness. We are stronger than the sum of our parts.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You coddle the weak. How is that a sign of strength?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The group is more powerful than the individual. Of course you're
              never going to understand that because it requires actual selflessness,
              of which you're incapable.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Having a group does not require equality. I have a group. They all
              work for me. And in the case that someone needs to make a sacrifice, I
              have the power to choose who it is.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/cardart_duneblast.jpg"></p>

                target="_blank">Ryan Alexander Lee</a></p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Black doesn't understand the importance of symbiosis. The idea that there is strength in working with
              others.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Give me a break. You don't believe in survival of the fittest? Nature
              is all about survival of the fittest. I love how you like to talk about
              the web of life and just gloss over the whole structure of the animal
              kingdom. If one creature is capable of eating another creature, it eats
              it. There's no equality. There's just lunch.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And all you can see is the predator/prey dynamic. There are just as
              many examples of animals who live together in harmony. There are even
              those who interact positively with another, fulfilling a needed role.</p>



            <p>So what exactly makes this relationship work in Abzan?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>When we put aside our personal squabbles, our power sets actually
              complement each other very well. I provide the proactive defense, Black
              provides the active defense, and Green provides the growth to speed
              along our mana development.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The other wedges are more focused on creating threats. We take the
              attitude of "The best offense is a good defense." If we can protect
              ourselves while our opponents deplete their threats, we can then exploit
              that vulnerability.</p>

            <p>Also, we have the resources of growth on our side. While we take a
              defensive posture in the early- and midgame, it allows us the
              opportunity to make giant threats in the late game. Usually, I have to
              use my resources to defend, but since White and Black have the tools to
              play defense, I can focus on getting us late-game threats quicker than
              our opponent can.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Essentially, our goal is making our enemies tire themselves out in
              their attempt to kill us. Once they're tired, they're easy picking.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I think the key to our strategy is the willingness to deemphasize threats in exchange for answers.</p>



            <p>To quote a famous former Pro Player named Dave Price, "There are wrong answers, but there are no wrong
              threats."</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Was he Mardu?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>There are plenty of wrong threats. It happens to me all the time. I
              have a kill spell in my hand, my opponent is playing a hexproof creature
              or a regenerator or something with protection from black. In fact,
              that's one of the basic strategies we use. We don't make a lot of
              threats because we don't want to enable our opponents' answers. You
              don't know true joy until you see the panic in opponents' eyes because
              none of their cards matter for the board state.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Black is being Black's typical self, but there is a ring of truth to
              what was said. The Abzan strategy is very simple: We hunker down and
              prepare for anything our opponents throw at us. When they've depleted
              their resources, then—and only then—do we step up and win the game. The
              strength of nature is in its ability to constantly endure.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Here's how I like to think of it: If you never lose, your opponent
              cannot win. All the other clans are focusing on how to win, while we
              focus on how to not lose. The key is dedicating all of your resources
              toward that defense.</p>



            <p>When we started, you each talked about your end goal and your means to achieve it. Can we talk a little
              about that?</p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Okay. My goal is power through opportunity. Here's what that means: I
              believe in merit. I believe that every individual should be given the
              opportunity to succeed. Those who are able to make use of that
              opportunity will thrive, while those who cannot will suffer. There's
              nothing fairer than people succeeding or failing based on their own
              merits.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You kill people. Your people. Routinely. How exactly is that giving people opportunity?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You're not seeing the big picture. Anyone who wants to work for me is
              able to. I turn no one away. Those who are useful rise in my
              organization. Those who aren't useful get used in other ways. You
              motivate your people your way, I'll do it mine.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Everything is seen through the lens of what they can do for you.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, each individual is responsible for looking out for itself. Part
              of doing that is understanding who is in power. If you are able to take
              that power, you should. If you are not, you need to respect it. My
              system is very simple.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Except for the little people.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The meek? Why, exactly, am I supposed to be rewarding weakness? I
              understand your way is all about rewarding existence, but I have a
              little higher bar. You want something out of life? Step up. Earn it.
              Giving away free handouts does nothing to encourage self-improvement.
              "Do or die" is a much better motivator than "do whatever you want and be
              rewarded anyway."</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Do you understand that there are enough resources in the world such
              that everyone can live comfortably? Everyone can be fed and healthy and
              safe. To do this, though, people need to stop taking more than they
              need. Your way encourages a select few to thrive at the cost of the
              welfare of everyone else.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And your way punishes those who have taken the initiative to make
              something better of their lives. You punish merit. You punish
              achievement. You punish motivation. Why should any individual strive to
              make things better if there aren't any rewards for doing so?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>There are rewards. They're just rewards for society as a whole and not for the individual.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So I should work hard so others can benefit?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yes!</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yes?! The fact that you answer "yes" to that is mindboggling.
              Unfortunately predictable, but mindboggling nonetheless. Green? I know
              you believe in survival of the fittest. That's what I'm talking about.
              Help me out here.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I do believe in survival of the fittest but you are warping what it
              means. A lion will kill a gazelle to eat it, but it only kills what it
              and its pride needs. It doesn't kill every gazelle it sees because it
              can. In fact, if the lion killed every gazelle, guess what would happen?
              Soon, there wouldn't be any gazelle for the lion to eat. Survival of
              the fittest is about doing what is needed to survive, not warping the
              entire system for selfish means.</p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But the lion gets to be king of the jungle because it can be. It earns that right.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, the lion is the king of the jungle because it was born into that
              role. No gazelle, no matter how much initiative it has or how much merit
              it demonstrates, is going to usurp the lion. The gazelle's hope is
              always to avoid being eaten by the lion, it is never to eat the lion.
              That is where your way fails. It assumes that, if given the opportunity,
              that the gazelle could fill any other role than what it was born into.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Blue has this one right. We are not locked into roles. We have the ability to shape who we are.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>All you have is the ability of self-delusion—to believe that you are not part of an already established
              ecosystem.</p>



            <p>I want to let White have a turn describing its philosophy. Green, we'll get to you next.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>My ultimate goal is peace and I achieve it through structure. Here's
              what that means: I believe that we can live in a world where everyone is
              able to have what they need. No one should ever be hungry or hurt or
              scared. We have the means such that everyone can live together in peace.
              Here's the problem: there are people like Black who look out for
              themselves at the cost of others, which prevents the utopia I am talking
              about from being possible.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Utopia? You don't often hear fascism being called utopia.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Everyone could live in peace. We have the resources. All that is
              stopping us is us. That's why structure is important. People need a
              moral compass, a set of ethics that spell out what is right and what is
              wrong. People are easily led astray, so a morality—a clear set of
              ethical codes—is crucial. Also, because people can be weak, we need a
              strict set of laws. Rules that explain what is and is not acceptable.
              Black is correct that people need motivations. The power of the group,
              and togetherness and love, will provide the positive motivations.
              Punishment through the law will provide the negative motivations. Do X
              or Y and there is a negative consequence.</p>

            <p>And how much freedom does one have to give up?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Freedom? Now you sound like Red.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Your imaginary utopia sounds wonderful...until you understand the
              cost it requires. People don't get to make decisions in your world.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yes, they do. As a group.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Fine. Individuals don't get to make decisions. If what you want is not what the majority wants, you're
              screwed.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Maybe if what you want is bad for the group, it's not a good thing to want.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Who knows if it's bad for the group? Maybe it's something the group
              hasn't thought about. Maybe it's something that matters to the
              individual in a way that it's never going to matter to the group. We, as
              a society, thrive because each individual has the ability to move in
              the direction he or she motivated. Maybe that one individual's idea will
              lead to something that later would benefit the whole group. But in your
              world, we'll never know, because the group won't allow it because the
              group doesn't understand it.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Maybe I would be more sympathetic to your belief in an individual's
              rights if I didn't know it was a means to motivate selfishness.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Selfishness is not a bad thing. It's okay to prioritize your own
              wants and desires. No one else is. The reason I think people need to
              look out for themselves is because they're the ones with the most
              incentive to do it. In my system, everyone has someone looking out for
              them: them.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And forget about everyone else?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, you're allowed to care about and help others. Just not at the
              sake of yourself. You shouldn't be forced to do something to your own
              detriment for the sake of others. You want to opt in and choose to do
              that? Fine. I believe it's idiotic, but I believe people have the right
              to do stupid things. My point is you shouldn't force that choice on
              anyone.</p>



            <p>Green, your turn.</p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Thank you. My ultimate goal is acceptance and my means to do that is
              harmony. All the other colors believe that in order to make a better
              world, we have to change it. My belief is that the world we have is
              already what we need. Instead of trying to change the world, we need to
              accept it for what it is. Trying to change the world is futile, so why
              don't we learn to accept what we have?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Changing the world is futile? You keep reminding me that I'm usurping
              the natural order. If it's so hard to change things, why would it
              matter what I do?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Would you allow me to finish explaining my philosophy before jumping in?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I see a pattern here. Whenever I do what I want, somehow it doesn't
              match your view of how things are supposed to be and I'm disruptive.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You are, in fact, literally being disruptive right now.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Fine. Go on, explain your exciting world view.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The world already has a set order and structure. Instead of trying to
              change it, I advocate understanding it. Harmony is the act of becoming
              one with something so you can understand it, not on an intellectual
              level, but on a spiritual one. To understand the earth, become one with
              the earth.</p>

            <p>Would you just let me know when I'm allowed to jump in and mock you?
              Take your time. I'm working up some good stuff here when you're ready.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Of course you belittle how I feel. You never take any time to understand anyone's beliefs but your own.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'll be on my best behavior. Let me ask you this: If individuals can
              do things to affect nature, why isn't that just part of nature itself? I
              mean, we're all creations of the earth. How are my actions any
              difference than a bear's?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The bear doesn't try to usurp the natural order. The bear has its role, which it embraces.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But what if the bear didn't? What if the bear went crazy and started killing everything in sight? Isn't
              that still natural?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>What is your point?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>My point is that you take so much care to point out what is natural
              and what's not natural. What if everything is natural? What if the world
              is whatever we make it? If I chop down a tree, then the world has one
              less tree.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And that one less tree has consequences. That's your problem; you
              don't care about consequences. You have an attitude that you can do
              whatever you want and ignore whatever the fallout is. People like you
              are why we have pollution.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And why we have crime.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You seem to think that a person doesn't have the responsibility for
              the outcome of his or her actions. The world is our most prized
              possession and it is our responsibility to take care of it. Part of
              acceptance is understanding what role we play, and then playing it.</p>



            <p>We've talked a lot about the conflict everyone has with Black. White and Green, do you have any
              conflicts?</p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I don't think Green and I have a conflict as much as we have slightly
              different world views. We both share our distaste for selfishness and
              the impact it has on the world. I think I focus a little more on the
              impact on society, whereas Green is a little more focused on the
              environment. We both focus on the needs of the group over those of the
              individual, but what those needs are is different. We both believe that
              there are ultimate truths, but what those truths are is not exactly the
              same. I believe in a sense of morality while Green believes in a larger
              natural connection. A web of life, if you will. Green, did I leave
              anything out?</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I think our biggest conflict is probably best represented by the
              conflict of our other allies. My other ally is Red, while White's other
              ally is Blue. I think, fundamentally, I see the bond of all living
              things as being something unspoken, something instinctual in nature. We
              are who we are because of what is inside us. It's not something we can
              consciously verbalize. I believe White leans toward a belief that
              betterment comes through a spelled-out thought process. That what ties
              people together is something they can all understand and agree on. So we
              want similar things, but the means to get there is very different.</p>



            <p>We're almost out of time, so I'll ask one last question. You are all
              working together as Abzan. Why don't each of you give one last pitch for
              why players should play your clan? Why don't we go in the same order as
              the introductions?</p>

            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Learning threats is valuable. Learning answers is invaluable.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>An enemy is at its weakest when it has tried to kill you and failed.</p>



            <p><img src="We%20Will%20Survive_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It is the simple blade of grass and not the mighty oak tree that best survives the storm.</p>



            <p><strong>Thank you three for joining us today. This was quite enlightening.</strong></p>
