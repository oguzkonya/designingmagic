            <p>Welcome to Mardu Week! This week we'll be talking about the
              red-white-black wedge. For each wedge theme week, I've decided to take a
              look at how the three colors in that wedge get along. To do this, I put
              the three colors in a room, ask a few questions, and then let them talk
              it out. I've previously interviewed the colors of <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/node/264676" target="_blank">Abzan</a>
              and <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mm/smart-thinking-2014-11-03" target="_blank">Jeskai</a>.
              If you want to read more about the color philosophies in general, you can go to my <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/features.aspx?tag=color%20pie"
                target="_blank">color pie page</a>, where I discuss all things color philosophy at length.</p>



            <p>My goal with the wedge series is to give you all a better sense of
              how the colors interact and feel about one another. If that's all
              understood, let's get started:</p>



            <p><strong>Hello, everyone. I've begun each of these interviews by
                having each color introduce itself. To follow tradition, we'll go in the
                order that the colors appear in the mana cost of a Mardu card.</strong></p>



            <p>I'm Red. I'm the center of the Mardu clan. I'm about achieving freedom through action.</p>

            <p><img alt="" src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm White. I'm about achieving peace through structure.</p>

            <p><img alt="" src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm Black. I'm about achieving power through opportunity. We're going have to repeat this every time
              we're interviewed?</p>



            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>



            <p><strong>Each time, I like to start by asking you all about the
                attribute of the wedge you are together in. How does each of you feel
                about speed?</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Wait. Before we get started, I just want to say something. This is my
              third, and thankfully last, interview. I find the structure of these
              interviews—or better, the lack of structure—to be untenable. If you want
              me to participate, I demand that there's at least a little bit of
              order.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Do not give in to this. No negotiating with terrorists.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>What? If anyone's a…no. Do not get sucked in. Stay on task. Stay on
              task. If you wish for me to participate, there have to be a few rules.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>"There have to be a few rules." I got it. Things White refuses to stop saying.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Do you even understand the point of these interviews? Rosewater wants
              to demonstrate the dynamic between the three of us. If you set up
              rules, it undercuts the entire structure.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Plus I was promised no rules.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Why does Red get promised no rules and I don't get promised rules?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Did you ask? When Mark approached me, I said I would come on one condition: no rules. Perhaps you should
              have done the same.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Demand an interview have rules?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yep.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>An interview, by definition, has rules. Why would I have to ask for
              something that's already part of the inherent nature of the thing?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Since you now want to change things, it seemed you made a false assumption.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm not trying to change things. I'm trying to get Mr. Rosewater to
              live up to the unspoken promise made when I was invited to an interview.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I like how you refer to something "un-promised" as "unspoken."</p>





            <p><strong>The question was: How do each of you feel about the attribute of speed?</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I like it. I'm a color of action so I like getting to the point as quick as possible. If I'm here to
              fight, let's fight.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Sometimes the best offense is hitting opponents before they're ready.</p>



            <p><img alt="" src="Finishing%20First_files/cardart_gurmagswiftwing.jpg"></p>

            <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Swiftwing" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Gurmag+Swiftwing">Gurmag
                Swiftwing</a> | Art by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5B%22Jeff%20Simpson%22%5D">Jeff
                Simpson</a></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Some of the colors spend so much time thinking and plotting and
              planning. You know how you win a fight? By hitting your opponents enough
              times to knock them out before they can do the same.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>One of the things I've always appreciated in Red is the "waste no
              time" attitude. There's a lot of power in being fast and brutal.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The key is to give up on thinking. Thinking just slows you down. Impulses are fast. Feel and move. Feel
              and move.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I do think speed can be used strategically. One of the best tricks is
              to figure out what your opponent would never expect and then do it.
              Hitting fast and hard out of the gate is one of those things.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Do you get the sense that somebody isn't participating?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Why, yes I do. Personally, I kind of enjoy it. White can be a little monotonous.</p>





            <p><strong>White, do you have any feelings about the attribute of speed?</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Don't play White's game. If White doesn't want to talk, let White not talk. Red and I will talk. We get
              along great.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>How about this? We can answer for White. That'll be fun. What do I,
              White, like about speed? I like lining up all my creatures in a line and
              then letting them out very orderly one at a time as quickly as I can.
              Human Warrior, Human Warrior, Human Berserker, Human Warrior.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I like proactively attacking things I've determined are evil, even though I advocate never striking
              first.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The best part is White literally has a mechanic called first strike. It's one of the things we like to
              bond over.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I, White, enjoy looking down my nose at any color that uses magic to kill other creatures. Well, you
              know, except myself.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So if I don't talk, you'll just use it as an opportunity to attack me?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I believe that's exactly what we're doing.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It is. Perhaps you noticed the mocking tone.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>An army is a finely crafted tool. One of its many features is its
              speed. By being small and nimble, an army is capable of neutralizing
              forces before they become threats.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And attacking all-out is pretty fun.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>One of the advantages of proper planning is that you can execute
              attack strategies fast, especially when you have an army made up of
              creatures you can summon quickly.</p>

                Nordstrand</a></p>



            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>How much planning does "Attack! Attack! Attack!" require?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I will not allow you two hooligans to misrepresent my beliefs, but that does not mean I have to interact
              with you.</p>





            <p><strong>Let's talk about what mechanical tools you three have for a strategy of speed.</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>All three of us have aggressive small creatures, with White and me having more than any other color.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Red and I have creature-kill to clear the path of our attacking creatures.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I can also neutralize creatures, but often by removing them from combat or preventing them from
              attacking or blocking.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Red and I can also do direct damage to a creature or opponent. Mine is usually done with a drain effect.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>White and I have first strike.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And double strike.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>White and I also have a lot of combat tricks; that is, instants we can play during combat.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>White and I have small fliers. We also overlap on lifelink, but I'm not sure how speedy that is.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Basically, the three of us all have the option of an all-in, aggressive attack strategy.</p>



            <p><strong>So, White, let's talk about what it's like working with your two enemies.</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Who do you want me to talk about first, Mr. Evil or Mr. Chaos?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Hold on. I love how you sell yourself as some kind of goody-two-shoes, yet you are constantly calling
              others by horrible names.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I thought you didn't believe in evil.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I don't. I do understand, though, what the concept means to you and
              others. You calling me evil is you calling me the worst name you can
              think of. It doesn't matter what I think of or believe. You are using
              harshly derogatory terms, as defined by yourself, when referring to me.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You don't see that as being hypocritical? Don't you preach the belief
              that everyone has good within them? Isn't it your job to bring peace to
              the world? I keep hearing you talk about it, yet you don't seem to walk
              your walk or talk your talk.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>How novel. The embodiment of evil telling me I'm not good enough.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm using your definitions, not mine.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Sometimes you have to be proactive to rid the world of evil.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Is that what you tell yourself? That calling me names and accusing me
              of things is you being proactive? You have such blinders on that you
              can't even begin to realize how much you don't see.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Illuminate me.</p>



            <p><img alt="" src="Finishing%20First_files/cardart_marducharm.jpg"></p>

            <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Mardu+Charm">Mardu
                Charm</a> | Art by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5B%22Mathias%20Kollros%22%5D">Mathias
                Kollros</a></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>All right. Supposedly, it's your goal for everyone to live in peace.
              You preach forgiveness, compassion, taking the high road. Yet every time
              you deal with me, I get none of those. The way you act toward me seems
              very much like the thing you find fault for in others. You prejudge me
              and then never take the time to know me. You have to define me as some
              boogeyman to scare all your followers. If evil doesn't actually exist,
              if it's something you just made up because you needed to keep everyone
              in line, that means that all along you've been the bad one, not me.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I thought you didn't believe in good or bad.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I believe in hypocrisy.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You want to know what it's like dealing with Black? This. Black seems to rejoice in twisting words and
              perceptions.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Once again, I'm just using your definitions.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>My world is defined by two things. A sense of morality and a sense of
              order. So having to work side-by-side with the embodiment of immorality
              and the embodiment of chaos is quite taxing.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Immorality? I'm not the color of immorality. I'm the color of
              amorality. Why? Because morality, and thus immorality, doesn't exist. I
              know it's comforting to you to believe in absolutes but that's just not
              how the world works.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And you know that how?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Unlike you, I don't keep my head in the sand. I don't believe in
              things that cannot be tangibly observed. I'll be honest. I'm pretty
              impressed with the concept of faith that you manage to sell so well.
              Believe in this thing that can't, by definition, be proven. Very clever.
              How can you ever be proven wrong when the cornerstone of your whole
              philosophy relies on people blindly believing?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm happy to be judged on my actions. Do I take advantage of others
              for my own gain? No. Do I lie and cheat and steal and basically do
              whatever I can for my own advancement? No. Do I kill others for nothing
              more than wanting what they have? No. What do I do? I look out for other
              people. I put the welfare of the group ahead of my own. I make
              sacrifices to help others.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So you're openly admitting that you're a fool?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's better than being a psychotic sociopath.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You do understand the difference between us? You enable weakness. I
              enable strength. You assume that people are incapable of caring for
              themselves so you have to step in. I assume that people deserve the
              right to prove what they are capable of. In my world, people earn what
              they get. There are no free handouts.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>In your world, the worst elements rise to the top. Power comes not from merit but from ruthlessness.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Ruthlessness? That's a topic for a different day. Red, you care to jump in?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I was just sitting here enjoying the show.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Where'd you get popcorn?</p>

            <p><img alt="" src="Finishing%20First_files/artedit_shatter.jpg"></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'd rather not say.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I feel like I've been monopolizing all of White's time. Would you like a turn?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I would.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>While you do that, I'm going to eat your popcorn.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I assumed you would. Hey, White. How you doing?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We've been doing quite well working together in Mardu. What if we just didn't fight?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But that's why we're here.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, we were brought here to talk, not fight.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Talk, fight, tomato, tomahto. This is a chance to discuss our differences.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We could do it calmly. It doesn't have to be an argument. It could be
              a sharing of contrast between our views. It doesn't have to get all
              emotional.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Did you just say "It doesn't have to get all emotional?" To me? You
              don't want to fight and your argument consists of demeaning the thing I
              hold most dear?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I chose my words poorly. I just meant that we could not do the thing we always do.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The thing where I get all emotional?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm not anti-emotion. I'm not Blue. Emotions have a very important
              role in bonding individuals together. My issue is that emotions can lead
              to people doing and saying things they don't mean.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, they do mean them. What emotions do is let people act in a way
              that they actually feel. That's my biggest problem with you and Blue.
              You're both so into suppression. What's so horrible about people saying
              what they think?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The problem is it causes conflict.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>What's so wrong with conflict? You're the "army color." You fight all the time.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You don't build an army to fight. You build it so you won't have to fight.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yeah, that's why you craft a weapon. So you can not use it.</p>



            <p><img alt="" src="Finishing%20First_files/cardart_ghostfireblade.jpg"></p>

            <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire+Blade" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Ghostfire+Blade">Ghostfire
                Blade</a> | Art by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5B%22Cyril%20Van%20Der%20Haegen%22%5D">Cyril
                Van Der Haegen</a></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Your problem is that you don't seem to understand the cost of conflict. You treat it like it's some form
              of entertainment.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And you treat it like it's the plague. Conflict is a normal part of the human condition. It's how people
              come to resolution.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But it doesn't have to be. People can work through their problems
              without having to fight. Instead of throwing punches, have you ever
              tried just sitting down and talking.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I don't solve every conflict with my fists. I get that's the
              stereotype you like to push to make me seem like a crazy color, but
              that's just one facet of who I am. Yes, if I have to fight I will, but
              that's not how I solve every problem. The big difference between when I
              sit down and talk and when you sit down and talk is that I say what's on
              my mind. I get to the point. If I have an issue with someone, I tell
              them and we work it through. I don't sit down and pretend like there
              isn't a problem and talk around the issue at hand like you.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You also don't always resolve the issue. In fact, you seem to escalate them far more often.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Is it better to just live in denial and let issues eat you up inside?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Every decision with you and Black is all about you. How will this
              affect you? What will you gain or what will you lose? You know what?
              Most of the time it isn't about you.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Again with the stereotypes. I get that Black's pretty selfish. No offense.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>None taken. I am pretty selfish.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But I very much care about others. I'm the color of love, of passion,
              of loyalty. I do things for other people. All the time! What I don't
              do, though, is make decisions for the benefit of absolute strangers. Why
              am I supposed to suffer for people I don't even know?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Every law can't be made to maximize what's best for you.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>How about we just make fewer laws then? You and your rules. We don't need so many rules.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You've already stated that you won't act in a way that looks out for
              people you don't know. You might not care about the impact you have on
              society, but that doesn't mean society doesn't care. If everyone just
              did what they wanted, it would be chaos.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Ah, chaos. Yes, another of your popular boogeymen. Oh no, you can't
              let "chaos" happen. That might mean you don't have absolute, complete
              control of everything. Heaven forbid things happen that you can't plan
              for in advance. Spontaneity must have its time and its place.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>In my world, there are irritations. In your world, there are deaths.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm glad you see the taking away of liberties as "irritations."</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>People don't have the right to do whatever they want?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Such as tell others what they can and can't do?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Why did I come here today? I really knew better.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But you had to. It was planned. It was on a schedule. I mean, what else could you do?</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/whitemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I get it. You two don't care about society. You want to do what you
              want to do and you don't want someone reminding you that maybe what
              you're doing is hurting someone else.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Close enough.</p>



            <p><strong>Black and Red, we've talked at length about why each of you
                have a conflict with White, but I'm curious what conflicts there exists
                between the two of you?</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Everyone, like White, wants to assume that because I pal around with
              Black that I'm just out for myself. I do have a hedonistic streak but I
              very much care for those I have an emotional connection with. I will put
              the welfare of a loved one ahead of my own, where I don't think Black
              is capable of that.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Red is a little reckless for my taste. I enjoy wanton destruction as
              much as the next color but Red too often makes poor long-term decisions.
              Red doesn't think about the consequences of its actions often enough
              for my liking.</p>







            <p><img src="Finishing%20First_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Probably the biggest difference stems from the conflict between our
              other allies, Green for me and Blue for Black. Black believes, like
              Blue, that people have a lot of control over themselves and their lives.
              I agree with Green that life is a little more preset and that things
              are likely not as able to change as Black and Blue believe.</p>

            <p>Victory is about depriving your opponent of resources, of which time is an important one.</p>
