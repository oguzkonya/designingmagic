            <p>Welcome to Rakdos Week! Finally! Yes, the ten-part two-color guild
              articles are finally coming to a close, this being number ten and all.
              (In case this whole series is new to you, feel free to check out my

              sorry for the delay, but <i>Coldsnap</i> doesn’t like to be ignored.</p>

            <p>The ten-part series was inspired by an original five-part series (six if you count <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/just-artifacts-maam-2005-02-28"
                target="_blank">artifacts</a>) on the mono color and their philosophies (<a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/its-not-easy-being-green-2002-10-21"

                target="_blank">red</a>).
              So if you like what you see here today, there’s lots more where this
              came from. Finally, as always, I should point out that my column today
              is not about the Rakdos guild in particular. Rather it is an examination
              of the philosophy that results from the overlap of black and red.
              Please check out Matt Cavotta’s “Taste the Magic” column this Wednesday
              to hear more about the Rakdos guild.</p>

            <p>As it’s been a while, let me recap how this is going to work. For
              each of these guild articles, I answer the following questions:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>What do the two colors have in common?</li>
              <li>How do the two colors differ? What is the guild's internal conflict?</li>
              <li>What does the guild care about? What is its end goal? What means does the guild use to achieve these
                ends?</li>
              <li>What does the guild despise? What negatively drives the guild?</li>
              <li>What is the color's greatest strength and biggest weakness?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the questions I will examine some aspect of the Rakdos
              that I feel is misunderstood. Then, as is tradition, I will end the
              column by giving some pop culture examples. This is then followed by
              numerous board threads and emails where all of you tell why I’m mistaken
              about one of my choices. And with that, you are now done with ever
              having to read this intro ever again. (And I never have to write it
              again – hoo haw!)</p>

            <h3>What do the two colors have in common?</h3>

            <p>The trick to understanding an allied color pair is to examine the
              color that shares their enmity, in this case white. So let’s begin by
              looking at what white represents. White is all about order, both civil
              and moral. The first half leads white to care about the law and the
              second to care about religion. White believes that there is a right and a
              wrong answer to every problem. White is also very focused on the needs
              of the group. White does not what is best for any one individual, but
              rather what aids the society at large. So what does this mean for black
              and red? They’ll have none of that.</p>

            <p>Black and red could care less about the needs of the group. Black/red
              believes that everyone needs to look out solely for themselves. The
              welfare of other people? That’s their business. (Okay, okay red does
              occasionally look out for those it has strong feelings about.) Black/red
              also doesn’t like rules. It does what it wants to do. It does what
              helps its cause. And since it has no allegiance to structure of any
              kind, be it laws or morality, the Rakdos does what the Rakdos wants to
              do. Which basically means creating mayhem and chaos.</p>

            <p>The biggest overlap between black and red is its desire to do what it
              wants and not allowing the needs of others get in its way. Black is
              more motivated by selfishness and red more by emotion, but the two
              combine nicely into hedonism in its purist form.</p>

            <h3>How do the two colors differ? What is the guild's internal conflict?</h3>

            <p>To understand the conflict between an allied color pair, you need to
              take a look at the conflict of the color’s other two allies. For Rakdos
              that is green (black’s other enemy) versus blue (red’s other enemy). The
              key green/blue conflict is nature vs. nurture. Green believes that
              things are born as they will always be. Blue sees creatures as coming
              into the world as blank slates that are shaped by their experiences. To
              green, you are born with your destiny. To blue, you create it.</p>

            <p>Black/red’s biggest internal conflict comes from this schism. Black
              sees the world as a place ripe for picking. As such, black is very
              motivated to try and change the world around it. Red, on the other hand,
              takes the world at face value. Red doesn’t want to work towards
              anything. Red just wants to deal with the world as it is. Black’s long
              term thinking clashes with red’s “think it now, do it now” philosophy.</p>

            <p>While many a guild’s internal conflicts are more philosophical in
              nature, Rakdos’ conflict is very internalized. Black/red acts both
              impulsively and with thought. Often at the same time. This makes
              black/red quite schizophrenic and, often times, just plum crazy. This is
              why Rakdos’ enemies have trouble predicting their behavior. Because
              even Rakdos doesn’t know what they’re going to do until they do it.</p>

            <h3>What does the guild care about? What is its end goal? What means does the guild use to achieve these
              ends?</h3>



            <div>
              <p><a> <img alt="Avatar of Discord" src="Hedonism%20With%20Attitude_files/Image.jpg"></a></p>
            </div>

            <p>To understand the guild’s goals, we have to first look at the goals
              of the two individual colors. We’ll begin with black. Black is motivated
              by a quest for power. Black wants it all – total control. Why? Because
              black is driven by selfishness. Black wants what will help black. To
              this end, black has learned that there is no commodity of greater value
              than power.</p>



            <p>Red, on the other hand, seeks freedom. Red wants to do what it wants
              to do. It doesn’t like anything that tells it can’t. Red is driven by
              its emotional impulses. When it feels something, it acts. If it is
              unable to act, it focuses all its energies on the thing stopping it.
              Once that is destroyed, then back to Plan A.</p>

            <p>The overlap between black and red is pretty clear. They want things
              their way. And both are willing to take the action necessary to make it
              happen. True, red tends to be more physical than black, but black is
              more than happy to take action, you know as long as it knows it’s going
              to win.</p>

            <p>The Rakdos achieve their goal through a willingness to do whatever it
              takes. Black/red is not held back by any sense of morality. Black/red
              doesn’t allow itself to be influenced by the needs of others (especially
              people it doesn’t know personally). Black/red looks out for number one.</p>

            <h3>What does the guild despise? What negatively drives the guild?</h3>

            <p>The easiest way to determine this is to just look at what the shared
              enemy wants. Once again, that would be white. White wants peace. White
              wants everyone to be happy with what they have. White wants people to
              sacrifice for the good of the group. White wants structure. White wants
              order. White wants morality. White just wants us to all get along.</p>

            <p>This kind of attitude just pisses black/red off. Black/red doesn’t
              care about others. It doesn’t want laws or religions. Those things just
              get in the way. Rakdos wants the world to bend to its whim. Sacrifice is
              good, just as long as others are sacrificing themselves to get you what
              you need.</p>

            <p>Nothing drives Rakdos crazier than seeing others try to live up to
              white’s ideals. Black/red can’t relate to people that put the needs of
              others first or wait for what they want. No, people like this deserve to
              be trampled over as black/red seeks out what it wants. A foolish end
              for foolish people. The only real value these people offer the Rakdos is
              that it’s fun destroying them. For example, lighting squirmy things on
              fire is a real hoot.</p>

            <h3>What is the color's greatest strength and biggest weakness?</h3>

            <p><img alt="Dread_Slag" src="Hedonism%20With%20Attitude_files/Dread_Slag.jpg">Black/red’s
              greatest strength is a complete uncaring of the consequences of its
              actions. Oftentimes, people are held back by their own self-imposed
              limitations. Rakdos doesn’t have this problem.</p>

            <p>Black/red’s greatest weakness? No self-control. When you live
              day-to-day doing what you want, it’s hard to learn any sense of
              discipline. Black/red often gets mad at itself for later realizing that
              it did something stupid. Not that it really slows black/red down, it
              just makes them angry. This, of course, only perpetuates the cycle as
              Rakdos can do real stupid things when it’s upset.</p>

            <h3>Bad to the Bone</h3>

            <p>For each of the guild articles, I like to examine an aspect of the
              guild that it misunderstood. For Rakdos, I want to talk about the
              difference of its two aspects. Both black and red will act out in its
              own self-interest trampling others in its wake but the reasons behind
              each color are actually quite different. I think many players falsely
              believe these two colors’ motivations are similar.</p>

            <p>So how does this differ from mono-red? Mono-red is driven by
              emotions. It does what it “feels” is the right thing to do. That said,
              red can very much get caught up in caring about others. Love, passion,
              loyalty, friendship – red’s into all sorts of bonding experiences. Red
              doesn’t set out to hurt others. It happens, but more as a side effect of
              red satisfying its own impulses more than any premeditated desire to
              cause others pain.</p>

            <p>Black, on the other hand, chooses its actions very much to make
              others suffer. Black is all about power. Black takes great pride in
              showing others their place. Black is the color that can actually enjoy
              watching others suffer. Because black cares about no one but itself.
              That said, black does not cause other people pain without a lot of
              forethought. Black is not short-sighted (like red). Black is very
              careful in the actions it takes because it does think of the “big
              picture.”</p>

            <p>Red is destructive without thought; black is destructive without
              care. Red will often feel sorry after the fact. Black, not so much. Red
              often accidentally hurts itself following its impulses. Black can cause
              itself pain, but only after weighing the options of what they get for
              such a sacrifice.</p>

            <p>While the two colors do have a lot in common, they are not made of the same cloth.</p>

            <h3>Crazy Selfish</h3>

            <p>Now comes the fun part where I illuminate the guild through pop culture references. Fun, fun, fun.</p>

            <p><img src="Hedonism%20With%20Attitude_files/mtgcom_daily_mr241_picMain_en.jpg"><b>The Joker</b>
              – I don’t know if a more black/red character exists. He’s selfish, yet
              still driven by a compulsion to entertain himself. He likes killing, but
              only if he can do it in the most chaotic way possible. He even has the
              telltale insanity.</p>

            <p><b>Elaine Benes (from <i>Seinfeld</i>)</b> – I promised that before
              the series was done, I’d place all four of the main characters from
              Seinfeld. I got a number of letters reminding me that I forgot Elaine. I
              hadn’t forgotten her, we just hadn’t gotten to the right column yet.
              Elaine is clearly black, as she, like most the characters on <i>Seinfeld</i>,
              is driven by selfishness. Time and time again Elaine demonstrates that
              she is motivated by what helps Elaine. Unlike Jerry and George though,
              Elaine is very much driven by her emotions. Elaine just can’t keep them
              under control. And they constantly get her in trouble. Black/red all the
              way.</p>

            <p><b>Spike</b> (from <i>Buffy, the Vampire Slayer</i>) – I originally
              listed Spike in my Orzhov (white/black) column. A reader wrote in to
              point out that everything Spike ever did was done through passion. Yes,
              he helps out the Scooby Gang, but not because he’s a good guy. He does
              it because he has the hots for Buffy. In fact, you can figure out
              Spike’s motivation for most episodes by figuring out who exactly he has
              the hots for that week. Spike is about as emotional as vampires come in
              the Buffyverse. Plus, as I explained in the Orzhov column, he’s totally
              selfish. Black/red.</p>

            <p><b>Anakin Skywalker</b> – I think almost all the Sith are black/red.
              Obviously they are driven by selfishness. The interesting thing is how
              the Sith masters harness the power of negative raw emotions of their
              apprentices to “turn them to the dark side.” Anakin’s descent into
              darkness is tightly connected for his inability to deal with certain
              emotions such as anger and passion. Throughout all the <i>Star Wars</i>
              films, it is clear that Anakin’s inability to handle his darker emotions
              was the thing that pushed him over the edge into becoming Darth Vader. I
              mean, come on, a black costume with a red light saber? The Sith aren’t
              even hiding their Rakdosness.</p>
