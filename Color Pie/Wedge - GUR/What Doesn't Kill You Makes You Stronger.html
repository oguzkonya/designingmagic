            <p>Welcome to Temur Week! This is the fifth and final clan-themed week
              and we'll be talking all about the green-blue-red wedge. As I've done
              for the previous four clan theme weeks (<a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mm/we-will-survive-2014-09-29"

                target="_blank">Mardu</a>),
              I'm going to put the three relevant colors in a room, ask a few
              questions, and then get out of the way as they talk among themselves. My
              goal for this entire series is to give you a better sense of how the
              colors relate and understand the differences and similarities between
              them through interaction. If you're interested in the topic of color
              philosophy, please check out <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/color-pie" target="_blank">this
                page</a>, which collects the many color pie articles (more than 20) I've written over the years.</p>



            <p>Let's get started:</p>

            <p><strong>Hello, colors. We're going to start this interview like the
                four others. Going in the order you appear in Temur mana costs, please
                introduce yourself, then explain your end goal and the means you use to
                accomplish it.</strong></p>



            <p>I'm Green. I'm the center of the Temur clan. I seek acceptance and I do so through harmony.</p>

            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>



            <p>I'm Blue. I seek perfection and do so through the acquisition of knowledge.</p>

            <p><img alt="" src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>



            <p>I'm Red. I seek freedom and attain it through action.</p>

            <p><img alt="" src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>



            <p><strong>Let's begin by having each of you explain how you feel about
                the attribute that ties your clan together. How do each of you feel
                about savagery?</strong></p>





            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Before we jump into this topic, I'd like to take a second to talk
              about the word "savagery." The word, as defined by the Merriam-Webster
              dictionary, is "The quality of lacking the restraints normal to
              civilized human beings." An alternative definition is "The quality of
              lacking complex or advanced culture." In each case, it is defined by a
              lack of a more cultured response.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>What are you doing?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>If we're going to discuss a word and what it means to us, don't we
              have to first understand the context of the word, linguistically?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I think examining the meaning of the word "savagery" is about as far
              away from savagery as one can get. Being savage is about giving in to
              one's impulses and instincts, of doing what needs to be done in the heat
              of the moment in order to survive.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But the definition implies it's contextual.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Must you overanalyze everything? Is it against the rules to just explain how something makes you feel?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I believe that savagery can be just as mental as it is physical or emotional.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Really?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But that's why there are three of us—because we each approach the attribute differently.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>To me, savagery is finding inner strength and drawing it out.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That is what mental fortitude is—just with your brain rather than your muscles.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So it's looking within.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yes.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Good. You do have a tendency to want to look without.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Meaning?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Life provides you with all the answers, and all you need to find them
              is to look within. When I talk about harmony, what I mean is learning
              to stop struggling with the universe and start realizing that the things
              you need are already within you.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I fundamentally disagree with that. We are born blank slates with
              ultimate potential, but that potential comes from without. Anyone can
              become anything, but you need knowledge, experience, and the proper
              tools.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Are you saying savagery comes from without?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that savagery is about
              overriding normal psychological limits that most likely developed as a
              means of protection. That way, you can perform an action that is outside
              your norm.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So savagery is like breaking rules?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I guess you could interpret it that way.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Good. I can get behind breaking rules.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>To me, savagery is about accepting your animal nature. Within each
              one of us, we have a connection to the web of life. That means we all
              have a feral side, and savagery is us tapping into that.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Replace animal nature with emotions and I'm down with that.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>To me, savagery is digging deep to find the mental strength within yourself to accomplish the task at
              hand.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I see very little thinking in savagery. When I'm at my most savage,
              I'm the furthest from inside my head. Being savage is listening not to
              your head but to your whole body. It's giving in to the primal forces
              that connect us to the earth.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I have to agree with Green here. Savagery is listening to your id, to
              the most basic elements of your psyche. There's no thinking going on.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Savagery has no mental component for either of you because you both shun thinking.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>What do you mean by that?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You both live by credos that reject the idea that rational thought is
              a positive force. That's why it's so hard to talk with the two of you,
              because you never bother thinking anything through.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I find it interesting that you equate us choosing not to do things your way as a sign of ignorance.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's not ignorance, it's apathy. You two don't seem to care. There's a
              world of knowledge out there that can help you with whatever task you
              have at hand, but the two of you feel as if using the experience gained
              by others is somehow forbidden.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>While you reject the mere thought that there exists something, outside of hard data, that can provide
              answers.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Data is objective.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Life isn't about objectivity.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Maybe not for you.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Does it ever bother you that you live in a cold world devoid of any feeling?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>What do you want me to do? Act on every whim like you? Make
              shortsighted decisions that prioritize whatever thought is at the
              forefront of my brain?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Does it make you feel more superior to think of every act I make as
              an irrational one? The only difference between you and me is our
              motivation. I'm trying to stay true to who I am and to those who I care
              about. I try to stand for something and make my life have meaning. You
              seem more motivated by trying to never make a mistake. Well, I hope
              you're happy in your sterile, cold, little life, never knowing what it
              is to be close to another individual or feel true happiness—or any real
              emotion, for that matter.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I have feelings. I have emotions. I just choose to understand them
              for what they are and not let them run my life. We are blessed with
              intellect for a reason, because it allows us the ability to shape who we
              are and what we can become. When my life ends, I'm going to be the best
              that I can become, while you're going to be the same fool you've been
              your entire life.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That's because I'm happy with who I am. Did you ever stop to wonder
              why you try so hard to change? Because you don't like who you are right
              now.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Red hit upon the key difference between you and us. We're focused on
              looking within and recognizing who we are and what makes us special,
              rather than seeking external answers to explain how we can become
              something else.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Do you ever laugh? Do you ever cry?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Do you ever embrace the miracle of who you are? Are you capable of enjoying a sunset or relaxing to the
              sound of the rain?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Are you two content with never aiming to improve yourself? Of never trying to do better, to become
              better?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>For someone who claims to value knowledge, you love jumping to
              conclusions. Red and I both strive to be better. We just don't do it
              your way.</p>





            <p><strong>Let's move on to the next topic. What mechanical elements do you three have for a strategy of
                savagery?</strong></p>





            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The three of us all have the capability of having bigger bodies, especially at common.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Green and I have trample. We also both have ability to pump our power
              and/or toughness. I have firebreathing. Green has the Rootwalla
              ability. Green and I both have spells that pump as well. Even Blue
              occasionally does +1/-1 boosting.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Using a similar theme of growth, Green and I both have access to card
              drawing. Green tends to focus its card drawing through creatures. Red
              and I both have access to looting, although mine is "draw then discard,"
              while Red's is "discard then draw."</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Green and I are both capable of damage. I do direct damage to
              creatures, players, and—indirectly—Planeswalkers. Green and I can both
              destroy artifacts and lands, while Green can also destroy enchantments
              and occasionally Planeswalkers. Blue doesn't destroy, but it can
              transform creatures, steal them, bounce them, and lock them down.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Green and I can use the advantage of surprise to ambush with flash. Red, and occasionally Green, has
              haste.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I also have a strong theme of variable power and toughness that grows
              over time. In addition, I'm able to distribute +1/+1 counters to make
              other things permanently grow.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Green and I also have access to mana. Green does it more permanently
              with land fetching and creatures that can activate to produce mana. I
              tend to have rituals or permanents that sacrifice themselves to produce
              mana temporarily.</p>

            <p>Creature keyword-wise, we each have creature keywords that can help
              us in a fight. I have hexproof, so no one can interfere in my fights;
              Red has first strike and double strike, to dominate fights; Green has
              deathtouch, vigilance, and reach, to upgrade its fights.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We all have the means to be tough when called upon, to make sure that we're the ones who win the fight.</p>





            <p><strong>Blue, let's talk a bit about what it's like to work with your two enemies.</strong></p>





            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I live my life around a simple premise—every problem has a solution.
              They key is to spend the time and energy to figure out what that
              solution is. For example, let's say I have a problem with a neighbor. We
              have a disagreement. I will take the time to understand what my
              neighbor's issue is. Why is she upset? Were there actions that I took
              that led to her being upset? Are there steps I could take to rectify the
              situation so that she's no longer upset? During the same timeframe that
              I would be calculating my next move, Green would be starting a fight
              with her while Red would be burning down her house. That's my major
              problem.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Your problem is that we take action? That we actually do something about our problems?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, my problem isn't that you take action. It's that you take action
              without thinking it through. You seek out the shortest path to every
              resolution.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Because the longest path is so much better?</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Are you even aware of the chaos you create? Emotions are dangerous.
              Impulses are reckless. It's like you put out every fire by throwing the
              nearest liquid on it, even when that liquid is gasoline.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>First off, I do not put out fires. Second, you act as if emotions
              aren't a core essence of who we are. They're not some faulty wiring.
              Your emotions are you. You live your life in self-denial, rejecting who
              you are.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We are more than just our base impulses. I reject emotion? You reject
              intellect. What makes us who we are is not what we feel but how we
              think. If we followed every impulse, we'd be no better than animals.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Hey! You should only hope that you live your life with half as much
              grace as any creature in nature. They don't live their lives in
              self-doubting angst. They embrace who they are and live it with every
              ounce of their being.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That's the difference between us and most animals. They don't have an
              intellect. They're not capable of higher thought. We shouldn't live
              like animals because we're better than them. We're capable of more.
              That's all I want. I just want people to live up to their potential.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You act as if intelligence is some marker of quality. So you're
              smarter. Someone else is faster. Someone else is stronger. Someone else
              is more compassionate. There are many different attributes to strive
              for. If you want that thing to be intelligence or knowledge or whatever
              high brain function you designate, great. Just stop judging everyone
              else by the same criteria. It's insulting and short-sighted.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p><em>I'm</em> short-sighted? Red is the poster child for "Hit first, ask questions later."</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You're the poster child for "Give me an hour and I'll get back to you."</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>There's nothing wrong with restraint.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yes, there is. You act as if inaction has no consequences. While you
              take your time to think the problem through, others are making the
              choices for you.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And when you act without thinking, you're dictating an outcome that you can't control.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Control is overrated.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>According to you!</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You keep saying you want to perfect yourself, but I don't understand
              how you do that if you reject the very idea of looking inward.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I value knowledge about myself. Part of growing is understanding your
              own strengths and weaknesses. What I don't do, though, is assume that
              there are forces going on beyond my comprehension.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Well, I'm glad you understand everything so there are no "forces beyond your comprehension."</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>For a color who's supposedly all about knowledge, you have a lot of ignorance.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm outnumbered by two colors incapable of logical discussion. I'm not sure what, exactly, we're going
              to accomplish here.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Heaven forbid the color who craves information ever learn anything from us.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I thought the key to learning was to keep an open mind.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm done talking about this. Let's move on.</p>





            <p><strong>Red and Green, it's clear you two have issues with Blue. I'm curious to hear about what
                conflicts the two of you have.</strong></p>





            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The simple answer is to look at the conflict of other allies—White
              for me and Black for Red. The White-Black conflict is about the needs of
              the group versus the needs of the individual. Red and I are definitely
              on different sides of this debate. I'm less civilized than White, but I
              do believe in the importance of the community. Creatures have to
              understand their roles in the web of life and be careful not to stray
              from those roles. Red, on the other hand, is much more
              individual-focused. Red's entire philosophy comes out of each individual
              following its own passion so, by its nature, Red's philosophy leans
              more toward the needs of the individual.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Green has two sides, a destructive side and a peaceful side. I get
              the former. I understand the need to take action and cause destruction.
              The peaceful side, though, is further from how I function. It's not that
              I need to fight all the time, because I don't, but I can't handle the
              inaction. I have to be doing something.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Red's not the color to meditate or even sit still for any great length of time.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And Green is a little too worried about how everything interconnects.</p>





            <p><strong>Our time is about up. Why don't we end this interview like
                we've ended all the previous ones. Give me a short, pithy pitch on why
                people should play Temur. Go in your mana order again.</strong></p>





            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>If you want to win, back the strongest fighter.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Believing you're capable of victory is the number-one quality needed to attain it.</p>







            <p><img src="What%20Doesn't%20Kill%20You%20Makes%20You%20Stronger_files/redmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The battle is won by the person who wants it more.</p>
