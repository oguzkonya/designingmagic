              <p><img>Welcome to Izzet Week. This is the third of our guild theme weeks for <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                block. (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/215">Selesnya
                  Week</a> was a month back and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/219">Azorius
                  Week</a>
                was two weeks ago.) This is the second time we've done guild theme
                weeks. The first was back during the original Ravnica block. For those
                theme weeks, I talked about the color philosophy of all the guild color
                pairs. (You can see all my guild columns <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/features.aspx?tag=color%20pie">here</a>.)
                This time, I'm examining each color pair from the eyes of design. What
                does it take to design blue and red together specifically, as well as to
                design for the Izzet guild? </p>

                For each of these articles, I am answering the same four questions and
                then talking in depth about each of the two guild mechanics, the one
                from the original <i>Ravnica</i> block and the new one in the <i>Return to Ravnica</i> block. As this
                is the third in the series, hopefully you've gotten the gist. </p>
              <h3>What's the Easiest Thing About This Color Pairing?</h3>
              <p>When you list the colors with the most creatures, from highest to lowest, it goes like this:</p>
              <blockquote> White<br> Green<br> Black<br> Red<br> Blue </blockquote>
              <p>It
                just so happens (not remotely coincidentally), if you flip this list on
                its head, you get the colors with the most instants and sorceries. What
                this means is that blue and red are the two "spell colors" in the game.</p>
              <p>When
                we look to combine blue and red, there's a lot of pull toward spells.
                Both Izzet mechanics, which I'll talk about in a moment, are based
                around instants and sorceries. In addition, the Izzet guild has a number
                of cards with what I'll call "instants and sorceries matter." These are
                all cards that reward you for playing a lot of instants and sorceries.</p>
              <h3>What's the Hardest Thing About This Color Pairing?</h3>
              <p>Of
                all the ten color pairings, blue and red have the least amount of
                mechanical overlap—especially at common. As an example, let's look at
                evergreen creature keywords in two or more colors:</p>
              <blockquote> Deathtouch (Black-Green)<br> Flash (Green-Blue)<br> Flying (White-Blue-Black)<br> First
                Strike/Double Strike (Red-White)<br> Haste (Black-Red)<br> Hexproof (Green-Blue)<br> Lifelink
                (White-Black)<br> Regeneration (Black-Green)<br> Trample (Red-Green)<br> Vigilance (Green-White)
              </blockquote>
              <p>Every
                two-color combination has something (and yes, white-blue and blue-black
                both only overlap at flying—that's its own problem) with the sole
                exception of blue-red. This is especially a pain when designing hybrid
                cards where the only design space is overlap.</p>
              <p>Also, while the two
                colors both make use of spells, how they use those spells tend to be
                very different. Blue is the slowest color, red is the fastest. Blue is
                the most reactive while red is the most proactive. The essence of what
                makes them enemies pulls them in very different directions.</p>

                  M. Fischer</a></p>
              <h3>What's the Mechanical Heart of This Color Pair?</h3>
              <p>Blue-red
                always comes back to spells because there just isn't that much
                connecting the two colors mechanically. Both like casting spells for
                their own reason, so the best way to tie them together is to find a way
                to connect their spellcasting. There are several ways to do this.</p>
              <p>First,
                you can do something to their spells. This is what both Izzet guild
                keywords did: Create a new ability that allows you to improve your
                spells and then give it to blue and red.</p>
              <p>Second, you can trigger
                off of instants and sorceries being played. This encourages a deck full
                of them, and as blue and red will have the most, this color combination
                will have the easiest time building this deck.</p>
              <p>Third, you can care
                about any type of spell getting played, as instants and sorceries tend
                to have more cheaper spells that can be used beyond the first few turns.
                This, for example, is why the storm mechanic tended to gravitate toward
                blue and red.</p>
              <p>Fourth, you can make permanents that get boosts
                when instants and sorceries are played. Izzet tends to like creatures
                with this ability, as it plays into the experimenter flavor of the
                guild.</p>
              <p> Fifth, you can interact with instants and sorceries. For
                instance, blue is able to bring instants back from the graveyard while
                red can get sorceries. This came about, by the way, because there are
                times we want cycles where each color brings back a different card type.
                Black, naturally, gets back creatures every set, with spells like <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+Dead"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Raise+Dead">Raise
                  Dead</a> and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Gravedigger">Gravedigger</a>.
                White is able to get back enchantments. Green can get back anything with <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regrowth"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Regrowth">Regrowth</a>-like
                spells, so it waited until everyone else chose. Blue wants instants to
                get back counterspells. So that leaves red with either sorceries or
                land. As king of land destruction, getting back land feels weird, so red
                gets sorceries. Thus, green gets land. </p>
              <p>Note that this is more
                limited than a lot of the other color combinations and tends to lead to
                more combinatory effects (which is fine, flavorwise, as the Izzet have a
                strong Johnny feel).</p>
              <h3>What's the Focus of This Color Pair?</h3>
              <p>
                Philosophically, when you combine the intellect of blue with the
                passion of red you get creativity. I like to refer to the Izzet as
                passionate thinkers. As such, the sensibility they have is one of
                experimentation. As a designer (and acknowledged Johnny), I tend to
                gravitate toward this <a href="http://www.rubegoldberg.com/">Rube Goldberg</a>
                feel. Blue-red wants to do things where things interact with other
                things and the end result is something bigger than the sum of its parts.
              </p>
              <p>Blue-red, more so than most color pairs, tends to build its
                decks around interactions happening. It's very common, for a Constructed
                Izzet deck, to start with a single card capable of grandiose potential
                and then build around it. I feel, of the ten guilds, the Izzet is the
                most Johnny (with Simic and Golgari coming in second and third).</p>
              <p>You'll
                note that the Limited game has less of that creative feel and the
                reason is that it's a lot harder to get a Johnny sensibility when you
                have so much less control over what cards you get. (Obviously, Draft
                moves closer to Constructed than Sealed.) As such, Limited play leans
                more on the mechanical connection—the spells—than the focus.</p>
              <p><img src="Designing%20for%20Izzet_files/mm221_replicate.jpg" alt=""
                  width="620"></p>
              <h3>Replicate</h3>
              <p> Some mechanics have glorious origin stories and some do not. Replicate falls into the latter
                category. The <i>Guildpact</i> design team (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mike%20Elliott">Mike
                  Elliott</a> as lead, with <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Aaron%20Forsythe">Aaron
                  Forsythe</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Devin%20Low">Devin
                  Low</a>, and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Brian%20Schneider">Brian
                  Schneider</a>)
                realized that blue and red overlapped the strongest on instants and
                sorceries and looked for mechanics that worked specifically on them. </p>
              <p>The
                original version of replicate was called polycast, and it allowed you
                to recast the spell as many times as you wanted when it was first cast.
                In this version, there was no separate cost associated with replicate,
                as it kept reusing the mana cost. This version was changed in
                development to have a cost associated with replicate. Why was the cost
                added if it matched the mana cost every time? Because we felt there was a
                decent chance of bringing the mechanic back, and that allowed us the
                flexibility to make replicate cards where the replicate cost was
                different from the mana cost.</p>
              <p>As a quick aside, players have asked
                which of the ten original Ravnica block mechanics do I expect to see
                return. Here are my thoughts:</p>
              <blockquote> Forecast (Azorius): Unlikely, for "repetition of play" issues.<br> Haunt (Orzhov): Unlikely,
                for confusion and likeability issues.<br> Transmute (Dimir): Unlikely, as we're cutting back on tutors.<br>
                Replicate (Izzet): Likely to return.<br> Hellbent (Rakdos): Unlikely, as it wasn't that well received
                and has limited design space.<br> Dredge (Golgari): Unlikely, for power reasons.<br> Bloodthirst
                (Gruul): Already brought back in <b>Magic</b> 2012.<br> Radiance (Boros): Unlikely, as it wasn't that
                well received and has limited design space.<br> Convoke (Selesnya): Likely to return.<br> Graft
                (Simic): It would need to find an environment where it made sense, but it has a chance of returning.
              </blockquote>
              <p>That
                means that only bloodthirst, convoke and replicate have a good chance
                of coming back, with graft being the one other mechanic that isn't
                "unlikely."</p>
              <p>The design of replicate was similar to overload in
                that it was all about finding small effects that would have value if
                they could be made into magnified versions. Most of the replicate cards
                are just running through the basic spell abilities of blue and red. As
                we wanted the mana cost and replicate costs to match, there was a little
                juggling, but mostly it was handled by development.</p>
              <p> The one
                other big issue was whether or not the spell was going to be one big
                spell or a bunch of little ones. The year before, the <i>Champions of Kamigawa</i>
                block had the splice mechanic, which combined effects into one large
                spell. Because Ramp;D was okay with making the mechanic better against
                permission, the "bunch of little spells" option was chosen. </p>
              <p>There's not too much else to say about replicate.</p>

                  feature article</a> about the creation of this mechanic. If you're interested in another take on it,
                you can read that here. </p>
              <p> This mechanic goes all the way back to the very first <a href="https://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/designersearch/home">Great
                  Designer Search</a>.
                The first design challenge was called "Gimme Five," and in it I made
                the contestants design three five-card cycles—one at common, one at
                uncommon, and one at rare. For each rarity, I randomly assigned them a
                card type. What follows are the cards Ken Nagle submitted for his common
                cycle of sorceries: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><b>Common Cycle—Sorcery: Dispersion</b></p>
                <p>
                  Dispersive Silence (Common) W Sorcery: Destroy target enchantment.
                  Dispersion 4W (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion
                  cost, target all enchantments.) </p>
                <p>Dispersive Mold (Common) G
                  Sorcery: Destroy target artifact. Dispersion 4G (When you play this
                  card, if you also paid the dispersion cost, target all artifacts.)</p>
                <p>Dispersive
                  Blast (Common) R Sorcery: Dispersive Blast deals 2 damage to target
                  creature or player. Dispersion 4R (When you play this card, if you also
                  paid the dispersion cost, target all creatures and players.)</p>
                <p>Dispersive
                  Path (Common) U Sorcery: Target creature is unblockable this turn.
                  Dispersion 5U (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion
                  cost, target all creatures.)</p>
                <p>Dispersive Revival (Common) B
                  Sorcery: Return target creature card in your graveyard to your hand.
                  Dispersion 6B (When you play this card, if you also paid the dispersion
                  cost, target all creature cards in your graveyard.)</p>
                <p> The
                  Dispersion (alternatives—Radiate, Splay) mechanic allows single targeted
                  spells to change from aimed missiles to cluster bombs. Since sorceries
                  make poor combat tricks, I dispersed Limited staples. I went simple.
                  Simpler. Then...simplest. The flashy fanciness is left for higher

                  and the whole thing did not have a lot of flaws. But it did not have a
                  lot of awesomely inspiring newness either. He played it pretty safe, and
                  a lot of the cards said to me "We really could make this card....But
                  which players are looking for this or will be excited to get it?"" This
                  week, the commons are a good idea, but some effects are not well chosen

                <p>Mark:
                  Kenneth, I felt this was a good week for you. Your initial submission
                  put you in the middle of the pack and the first design challenge has
                  advanced your standing.</p>
                <p>Your common cycle used the dispersion
                  mechanic. It's a good mechanic that I could see us using. It has the
                  nice flexibility in that it can be burned early cheaply for a small
                  effect or create a larger effect later for a larger cost. The reason we
                  do many mechanics like this is they help make limited play smoother (see
                  question #18 on the Great Designer Search Multiple Choice Test).</p>
                <p>My
                  biggest issue with the mechanic was that you chose the wrong effects. I
                  believe this mechanic can be used at common, but both effects have to
                  be acceptable for common. In addition, I think you want most of the
                  dispersion costs, especially at common, to be colorless mana because it
                  lessens color screw. Finally, you want to have some dispersion costs
                  that are a little cheaper. An example of what I would want to see is
                  something like this:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p> Dispersive Boost<br> W<br> Instant<br> Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn. Dispersion 2
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
              </blockquote>
              <p> Ken claims that the dispersion mechanic was inspired by the <i>Torment</i> card <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiate"

              </div>
              <p>The
                judges all basically said the same thing—the dispersion mechanic was
                interesting but it required some nuance in what effects you used. As I
                said in my review, the mechanic could work at common "but both effects
                have to be acceptable at common".</p>
              <p> Flash forward to the first design meeting of <i>Return to Ravnica</i>.
                Ken suggested dispersion as the Izzet mechanic. My response: "I
                remember that." Everyone liked the mechanic and it stayed the Izzet
                mechanic for the remainder of design and development. </p>
              <p>The
                challenge with the mechanic kind of stemmed back to Ken's initial
                design. It's neat in concept but tricky in execution. One, both effects
                have to work in the rarity of the card. Two, there's a big swing between
                targeting one thing and targeting all things. Three, you have to make
                sure the cards don't become too hard to process. This happens when it's
                unclear whether or not you even want to use overload because things are
                happening to you and your opponent.</p>
              <p>Let's walk through how we solved each problem.</p>
              <h3>#1—The Rarity Issue</h3>
              <p>The
                easiest way to solve this was to make sure the overloaded version was
                something we would do in the rarity the card was in. At common, this
                means the targeting-all option had to also be a common effect. We simply
                had to see what target-all effects existed at common to get a list of
                possible effects. At higher rarities, as long as the larger effect fit
                the rarity we were good. It was okay if the single effect was from a
                lower rarity.</p><br>
              <h3>#2—The Swing Issue</h3>
              <p>This ended up being
                more of a development issue than a design one. The key for design was
                making sure we were making effects where both sides would want to be
                played at different times.</p><br>
              <h3>#3—The Processing Issue</h3>
              <p> We
                solved this problem by deciding that we didn't want overload to ever be
                downside (well, at least not most of the time). To help solve this, we
                figured out who you wanted to affect—you or your opponent—and then put
                that into the targeting. For example, let's look at <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Mizzium+Mortars">Mizzium
                  Mortars</a>. </p>
              <p>The
                card says "target creature you don't control," so when you used
                overload it just hit your opponent's creatures. If the effect was
                something positive you wanted on your own creatures we said "target
                creature you control."</p>
              <p> Overload didn't have a lot of turmoil in either design or development and was printed pretty much as
                design intended. <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Matt%20Tabak">Matt
                  Tabak</a>
                okayed the fun rules text that Ken wanted (replacing all instances of
                "target" with "each"). And that is how overload finally made it to print
                eight years later. </p>
