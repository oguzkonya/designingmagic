            <p>Welcome to Simic Week! Okay, that's not exactly true. Welcome to the
              Week Before Simic Week! What's going on? Well, next week's Simic Week
              and I've committed myself to this little ten piece series (you can check
              out my <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr196">Selesnya</a>,
              <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr199">Golgari</a>, <a
                href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr201">Dimir</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr205">Boros</a>,

              columns by clicking on the links), of which the Simic column would be
              my ninth. The problem is that next Monday is Memorial Day (an American
              holiday honoring those who have died in the line of duty to the country
              for my non-American readers) and <b>magicthegathering.com</b> doesn't do
              new columns on major holidays (major defined as Wizards being closed).
              So I've decided to do my column a week earlier. The column I planned for
              today will run in two weeks (don't worry, I haven't forgotten about
              it).</p>

            <p>This ten-part series on the guilds was inspired by an original five-part series on the five mono colors
              (“<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr43">It's Not Easy
                Being Green</a>”, “<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr57">The
                Great White Way</a>”, “<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr84">True
                Blue</a>”, “<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr109">In
                the Black</a>”, and “<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr133">Seeing
                Red</a>”.), six if you count my <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr165">article
                on artifacts</a>.
              Feel free to read all that came before this if you enjoy today's
              column. Also, I should point out that this column is more about the
              interaction of blue and green than it is about the Simic guild in
              general. For more on the Simic, I suggest checking out Matt Cavotta's
              column (“Taste the Magic”) a week from this Wednesday – you know, during
              the actual Simic Week.</p>

            <p>I always start each of these columns by reminding you all of the questions I ask each time:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>What do the two colors have in common?</li>
              <li>How do the two colors differ? What is the guild's internal conflict?</li>
              <li>What does the guild care about? What is its end goal? What means does the guild use to achieve these
                ends?</li>
              <li>What does the guild despise? What negatively drives the guild?</li>
              <li>What is the color's greatest strength and biggest weakness?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As always I'll end the column with a quick discussion of a
              Simic-related topic and a few pop culture examples to spice up the
              thread and my e-mails. Whew, only one more time and you'll never have to
              read the “welcome to the guild series” introduction ever again. (Well
              until we do the tri-color guild block.)</p>

            <h3>What do the two colors have in common?</h3>

            <p><img src="Improving%20Upon%20Nature_files/mtgcom_daily_mr229_pic1_en.jpg">As
              faithful readers of this series are aware, we always start with enemy
              pairs by examining the core conflict between them. For Green and Blue
              it's another classic: Nature vs. Nurture. Let's start with the Green
              half. Green believes that things are born with all their potential
              already built in. People (and all other living things) are essentially
              slaves to their genes. Whatever nature intended for you to be is what
              you will be. Green doesn't see this as a bad thing. Rather Green
              embraces it. To Green, this is the center of great calmness. Everyone
              else struggles to find where they fit in the world. Green's attitude is
              that you don't have to find your role in the world - your role will find
              you.</p>

            <p>Blue, on the other hand, sees everyone starting as a blank slate.
              Blue believes that anyone can become anything. The key to doing this is
              knowledge. With knowledge comes the answers about how to change.
              Anything can be adapted as long as the transformation is understood.
              Blue takes great comfort in the fact that anyone has the potential to
              become whatever they desire. If you truly desire something, blue
              believes nothing is unattainable.</p>

            <p>Green and blue approach their problems from opposite ends of the
              spectrum. Green wants everything to be left alone. Green just wants
              nature to proceed unobstructed. Blue wants to meddle with everything.
              Blue wants to “fix” things and make them better. Green embraces nature.
              Blue embraces technology. Green favors reality. Blue favors illusion.
              Green acts without thinking. Blue never acts without thinking.</p>

            <p>So how does this odd couple come together? By finding the overlap in
              their two philosophies. Green wants nature to evolve. Blue likes to
              tinker. What if you took Blue's inclinations and applied them to Green's
              subject matter? What if the Simic strived to improve upon nature? (See,
              the titles do mean something.) For example, when two different species
              mate, they create a hybrid offspring. Nature left to its own accord does
              some of the experimentation that blue does in the laboratory. The Simic
              latches onto this tendency of nature to evolve and just speeds it up a
              little. These kinds of things would happen… eventually. Green/Blue is
              just facilitating nature, you know, at an accelerated speed.</p>

            <p>When you start looking at the two colors, you realize that there is a
              little bit of overlap. Both colors enjoy changing themselves. Both have
              the ability to shift and advance over time. Both have protective magic
              to prevent other magic from hurting their creatures. Both colors have
              some ability to draw cards and to search their own library. The two
              colors are a lot closer than you might realize at first glance.</p>

            <h3>How do the two colors differ? What is the guild's internal conflict?</h3>

            <p>While the two colors overlap in their interest to see how nature can
              evolve, their motivations couldn't be more different. Green simply wants
              to speed along the natural process. Blue enjoys the experimentation
              because it wants to see what is possible. Green is trying to find a
              short cut. Blue is trying to find tricks that will allow it to do very
              unnatural things elsewhere.</p>

            <p>The guild's internal conflict comes from these varied motives.
              Green/Blue is advancing two opposing desires. The Green half feels that
              it is promoting nature. The Blue half thinks it's exploiting it. (And
              the use of the words “feel” and “think” are far from an accident.) The
              Simic understand that their two goals conflict with one another.</p>

            <p>The result of this internal conflict is that the Simic are quite mad
              and a little bit paranoid. They are so focused on their task at hand and
              so in denial of what cause they are advancing that Green/Blue follows
              its own fevered style of logic. Experiments naturally lead from one to
              the next without the Simic ever stopping to really understand what
              they've done. This obsession is so strong that they lose all other
              focus. To put it another way, the Izzet are the absent minded professors
              of Ravnica. The Simic are the mad scientists.</p>

            <h3>What does the guild care about? What is its end goal? What means does the guild use to achieve these
              ends?</h3>

            <p>To understand the goal of the guild, we need to start by looking at
              the goal of the two colors. Green seeks growth. Green wants nature to
              flourish. It wants the status quo to continue unabated. Blue seeks
              knowledge. Blue wants to learn every secret of the universe. Why?
              Because this knowledge will allow it to shape the world in whatever
              image it desires. When you combine these two goals together, you get a
              guild that wants ultimate knowledge of nature to allow it to speed along
              nature's evolution. The guild wants to use knowledge as a means to
              propagate growth.</p>

            <p>So what does the guild care about? Evolution. Green/Blue is laser
              focused on understanding how nature advances. The Simic want to be an
              agent of natural change. As Green/Blue sees it, it is a part of nature.
              It advances nature because nature created it to do just that. The Simic
              were born to be a catalyst of change.</p>

            <p>The tools Green/Blue uses most are observation and experimentation.
              The Simic utilize both of these very aggressively. It is not bound by
              any rules, civil or moral, in what it will examine or how it will try to
              adapt something. If Green/Blue gets an inkling into its head, it will
              explore despite the consequences.</p>

            <h3>What does the guild despise? What negatively drives the guild?</h3>

            <p>The key to understanding what an enemy pair despises is looking at
              the two other enemies of the two colors and see what those two have in
              common. Green's other enemy is Black. Blue's other enemy is Red. What do
              Black and Red have in common? Self Interest. Red and Black do what they
              want to advance their own personal goals. While Blue/Green is very
              reckless in its methods, its motives are very unselfish. Green/Blue
              believes it is advancing the greater cause. Green/Blue never focuses on
              itself.</p>

            <p>This is one of the great ironies of Green/Blue. It is mindless in its
              quest and willing to do whatever it takes to advance it, yet has great
              disdain for self promotion. Green/Blue sees its greatest obstacles as
              those who do not understand its mission. Only by action of these
              individuals can its great plan be halted. It is therefore Green/Blue's
              mission to stop these forces before they intervene on Green/Blue's
              experiments.</p>

            <h3>What is the color's greatest strength and biggest weakness?</h3>

            <p>Green/Blue's greatest strength is its focus. The Simic are willing to
              go where its data leads it. Once it has the bread crumbs leading to its
              goal, nothing will move it off its course, even if something has gone
              wrong internally.</p>

            <p>This leads to Green/Blue's greatest weakness: its inability to stop
              what its doing. Green/Blue is so focused in its goal that it often
              cannot see the forest for the trees. Things that might seem obvious to
              anyone with some perspective are ignored by Green/Blue. As far as
              Green/Blue is concerned, the others don't understand what it's up to and
              it doesn't have the time to explain.</p>

            <h3>Creature Comforts</h3>



            <div>
              <p><a> <img alt="Trygon Predator" src="Improving%20Upon%20Nature_files/Image.jpg"></a></p>
            </div>

            <p>For each of the guild articles, I've chosen to examine a topic that
              is relevant to the guild at hand. For Green/Blue I thought I'd look into
              R&amp;D's decision to focus the guild on creatures. At first blush, the
              decision might seem a little odd. While Green is the color most focused
              on creatures, Blue is the least. And most of Green and Blue's overlap
              doesn't happen in creatures. In fact, when you look at the creatures in
              Green and Blue they seem like bitter enemies. Blue is the flying color.
              Green is the anti-flying color. Blue is one of the colors with the
              smallest average creature size (second to white). Green is the color
              with the highest average. Blue's creatures are more utility based (that
              is they tend to have more activated abilities that help control the
              game). Green creatures are more focused on being played and attacking.</p>



            <p>The decision to focus on creatures is threefold. First, all the
              guilds in general were more apt to care about creatures. This stems from
              the fact that we focused on the guilds as being a collection of
              creatures. Second, many of the other blue-based guilds had a less than
              average focus on creatures. The Izzet, for example, were the guild all
              about instants and sorceries. And third, the flavor of the guild wanted
              to focus on creature experimentation. When you think about a guild that
              experiments on nature, you imagine the guild doing many crazy
              experiments on creatures.</p>

            <p>With this in mind, we decided to try and find a keyword mechanic for
              the Simic that was a creature keyword. We also wanted it to capture the
              feeling of the Simic “evolving nature”. I'm quite happy with the “build
              your own monster” feel that the Simic ended up with.</p>

            <h3>Mad About Doctors</h3>

            <p>Last, but not least, a few pop culture references to add a little spice.</p>

            <p><b>Dr. Moreau</b> – I mentioned the good doctor last time I talked
              about the Simic. If ever there was a character who embodied advancing
              nature, Dr. Moreau is it. He took the idea of improving nature to the
              extreme.</p>

            <p><b>Dr. Frankenstein</b> – Note that I'm talking about the scientist
              and not the monster. Like Dr. Moreau, Dr. Frankenstein really did feel
              that he was advancing a greater cause. And he too was a little mad. Now,
              I'm sure in the threads that I'll get some people claiming that the
              good doctor is Black/Green. I mean he was raising the dead after all.
              But I believe that Dr. Frankenstein was not driven by self-interest, but
              by a desire to advance science. He was messing with the laws of nature
              because he was obsessed in his quest. Can you get much more Simic than
              that?</p>

            <p><b>John Hammond (from <i>Jurassic Park</i>)</b> – This is the man
              (played by Richard Attenborough in the film) who brought the dinosaurs
              back to life. The character as portrayed in the film (I believe the
              character in the novel to be more driven by self-interest) was drawn to
              his actions by a desire to play with the very fabric of nature. He was
              advancing nature in a different way, bringing back that which nature had
              left behind, yet he has all the telltale signs of a man caught up in
              his obsession to improve upon the world set before him.</p>

            <p><img src="Improving%20Upon%20Nature_files/mtgcom_daily_mr229_pic2_en.jpg"><b>Dr. Otto Octavius (from <i>Spider-man
                  II</i>)</b>
              – For those of you out there that might not recognize the name, this is
              the man who become Doctor Octopus. (I refuse to call him Doc Ock. While
              I don't mind the nickname, it annoyed me that the film refused to use
              the term Dr. Octopus as if they were embarrassed by the name. The hero
              is called Spider-man. How embarrassing can being named after another
              animal be? But I digress...) The reason I've included Octavius here is
              that the pre-Dr. Octopus is a perfect example of Green/Blue. He is
              obsessed with finding a new way to play with the very laws of nature.
              His focus is so strong that he dismisses all the dangers with what he is
              doing.</p>
