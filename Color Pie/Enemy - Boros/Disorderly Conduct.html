            <p>Welcome to Boros Week! This is the last of the <i>Ravnica</i> guild theme weeks and the fourth of ten of
              the <i>Ravnica</i> block guild theme weeks. Come <i>Guildpact</i>,
              I'll dedicate three different weeks to the black/white (the Orzhov
              Syndicate), red/green (the Gruul Clans) and blue/red (The Izzet). Then
              as <i>Dissension</i> rounds the bend, I'll touch upon black/red (The
              Cult of Rakdos), green/blue (The Simic Combine) and blue/white (The
              Azorius Senate). As always I feel obliged to point out that the ten
              two-color philosophy articles are based on a series of mono-colored
              philosophy articles I did – on obviously white, blue, black, red and
              green. ("<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr133">Seeing Red</a>"
              has links to the other four, so all you need is that one link to find all five articles.)</p>

            <p>But enough of the past and future. There's no time like the present.
              And in the present we're talking about red/white (aka The Boros Legion).
              Note that I'm talking about the philosophy of the intersection of red
              and white and not about the Boros Legion in particular. You'll have to
              wait for Matt's column (“Taste the <b>Magic</b>”) later this week for that. To explain color pie
              intersections, I always answer the following questions:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>What do the two colors have in common?</li>
              <li>How do the two colors differ? What is the guild's internal conflict?</li>
              <li>What does the guild care about? What is its end goal? What means does the guild use to achieve these
                ends?</li>
              <li>What does the guild despise? What negatively drives the guild?</li>
              <li>What is the color's greatest strength and biggest weakness?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sound good? Then on with the show.</p>

            <h3>What do the two colors have in common?</h3>

            <p><img src="Disorderly%20Conduct_files/mtgcom_daily_mr205_picMain_en.jpg">The
              key to understanding an enemy color pair is to examine what conflict
              defines them. For red and white that is the eternal conflict of chaos
              and order. White is all about structure. White wants peace and harmony
              for everybody. To ensure this happens, white lays down the law, quite
              literally. White knows that its rules upon rules will make sure that
              everyone is doing what they should to guarantee a peaceful community.
              Red, on the other hand, is very much about following its heart. Red does
              what it feels it should do. Now, when everyone acts on their own wants
              and desires it causes some conflict. Red's okay with that. Conflict is
              an essential part of life. If two people disagree let them smack each
              other around. Ideas like this lead to chaos. Once again, red's okay with
              that.</p>

            <p>So how does the force working towards order commingle with the force
              working towards chaos? The answer is to let each part have its role in
              how the guild functions. One half picks the goal while the other half
              chooses the tools to accomplish the task. This leads to two
              possibilities. A group with a moral center using whatever it feels is
              necessary to get the job done (this is the Boros for those that care).
              Or a group bent on creating anarchy that uses careful planning to bring
              it about.</p>

            <p>The two colors actually have more in common than you might first
              think. First, both colors are very driven. True, by different things
              (morals for white and emotion for red), but nonetheless both create
              fervent followers willing to die for their cause. Second, both embrace
              the military although at opposite ends of the spectrum (the orderly
              platoon versus the ragtag mob). And third, both colors have a very
              aggressive “attack first, ask question later” streak that seeps out into
              deck archetypes (white weenie and sligh).</p>

            <p>White and red might be on two different sides but they do share the
              same coin. Their actions are often so similar that you need to
              understand their motivation before you can tell whether they're red or
              white.</p>

            <h3>How do the two colors differ? What is the guild's internal conflict?</h3>

            <p><img src="Disorderly%20Conduct_files/mtgcom_daily_mr205_pic1_en.jpg">As
              stated above, red and white want diametrically opposed things. White
              acts as a means to bring the community together. To safeguard the needs
              of the many. Red acts to ensure that each individual has the freedom to
              do whatever it wants even if that freedom imposes on others. White makes
              rules. Red breaks rules. White carefully builds structure. Red breaks
              down structure wherever it can find it.</p>

            <p>The internal conflict of the guild stems from this divergence.
              Red/white is always focused on its goal but its ends don't always match
              its means. Red/white often finds itself breaking the very rules it has
              set out to create. To create peace, it will kill. To ensure freedom, it
              will enslave. Its long term strategy and short term tactics are
              constantly at odds with one another.</p>

            <p>This internal disconnect makes red/white hard to understand. Sure,
              red/white knows what it's up to but those around it are always a little
              taken aback at what it is willing to do to get the job done.</p>

            <h3>What does the guild care about? What is its end goal? What means does the guild use to achieve these
              ends?</h3>

            <p>To understand what red/white seeks, we need to look at the desires of
              each of the colors separately. White wants peace. Red wants freedom.
              White wants everyone to have security. Red wants everyone to have
              choices. The balance is that red/white seeks all of these things for
              some of the people. Red/white is king of rationalization. That is,
              red/white comes up with reasons to explain why chaos is in fact order.
              And why order is in fact chaos. Red/white is also the master of
              compromise (to itself, that is). To save some, it will sacrifice others.
              To establish a rule, it will break the very rule it is trying to
              establish. It will live up to its high ideals no matter how low it has
              to stoop to live up to them.</p>

            <p>Red/white's end goal is to have a purpose that it uses all its energy
              to reach. What is that end goal? Ironically, it is to either create
              peace or to create chaos using the opposite as a tool to do so. In the
              end, red/white is trying to find a way for order and chaos to co-exist
              without any uncomfortable side effects. And when those happen, it
              brushes them under the rug or rationalizes why they aren't such a
              problem.</p>

            <p>While red/white is conflicted in what it wants, it is not conflicted
              in how it hopes to accomplish it. Take your people. Give them the same
              goal. Give them the same means to reach that goal and then get out of
              the way. The drive of red/white's followers is so fanatical that
              red/white doesn't need to spend any more time indoctrinating them.
              Red/white just paints the bullseye and let's the force that is their
              legion do what it must.</p>

            <h3>What does the guild despise? What negatively drives the guild?</h3>

            <p><img src="Disorderly%20Conduct_files/guild_boros_pic.jpg">The
              key to understanding what an enemy color pair despises is to look at
              the other enemies of the two colors and see what those two colors have
              in common. Red's other enemy is blue while white's other enemy is black.
              What do blue and black have in common? Sneakiness. Indirectly and
              subtly accomplishing one's goal. Red/white hates that. Red/white is all
              about being open and honest about what you're doing. If I'm planning to
              cave in your skull, I tell you to your face what I'm going to do.</p>

            <p>Red/white is all about being focused and direct. It doesn't get
              subtlety. It wants to see its enemies coming because it enjoys a good
              fight. Being sucker punched or stabbed in the back is so not what
              red/white wants to have happen. Red/white wants things played by the
              rules. You know, the rules it made. If its enemies don't understand its
              rules, that's okay. But at least red/white has them. Playing without
              clear-cut rules is cheating. And red/white does not condone cheating. At
              least not what it defines as cheating.</p>

            <h3>What is the color's greatest strength and biggest weakness?</h3>

            <p>Red/white's greatest strength is its focus. When it decides to do
              something there is no hesitancy. It acts forcefully and brutally. It
              does what's needed to get the job done. Whatever it takes.</p>

            <p>Red/white's greatest weakness is its complete lack of subtlety.
              Red/white's enemies always know exactly what red/white is up to because
              red/white tells them. To their face. Multiple times. Red/white doesn't
              hide anything. And quite often that's a big liability.</p>

            <h3>“You Like Me, You Really Like Me”</h3>

            <p>In Aaron Forsythe's Friday column (“Latest Developments”) he always
              does a poll at the end. Sometimes, R&amp;D uses those polls to gather
              information on some topic we've been discussing. Knowing that <i>Ravnica</i>
              was coming up, Aaron asked what were people's favorite two-color
              combinations to play. Red/white finished last. It was even beat out by
              “I don't play two-color decks”.</p>

            <p>What this meant was that we knew we had an obstacle on our hands when we were designing red/white. It
              came into the <i>Ravnica</i>
              block as the least favorite color pair. What could we do to give it
              some love? The answer, it turned out, was to play into the most positive
              area that the two colors overlapped in. And that was the weenie deck.
              Both white and red have mono-colored weenie decks that have been popular
              for many years. What if the Boros put white weenie and sligh together
              and made a cute little love child? Every other <i>Ravnica</i> guild
              seemed to have forces that made them want to slow the game down. What if
              one guild, we thought, just went for the throat? Who doesn't love
              over-aggressive decks? They have a singularity of purpose that is very
              refreshing to play.</p>

            <p>And it turns out that our plans have worked even better than we
              hoped. Our data (things such as decks played in key events, sales of
              pre-constructed decks, feedback in e-mail and on the boards, etc.) has
              shown that red/white has been the sleeper guild of <i>Ravnica</i>. Players are embracing it with a love
              I've never previously seen for red/white. I know the <i>Ravnica</i> design and development teams are
              quite excited about it.</p>

            <h3>Orderly Chaos</h3>

            <p>I couldn't end without the ever-so-controversial examples from pop culture.</p>

            <p><b>The Punisher</b> – For those of you that don't read comics (or see
              really bad movies), the Punisher is a man named Frank Castle whose
              family was gunned down by mobsters (they were accidentally caught in
              some crossfire). To make amends, he has vowed to stop all people like
              those that took his loved ones. How? By killing them, of course. Aha,
              you say, he kills, doesn't that make him black? No, killing for selfish
              gain is black. What the Punisher does is not for himself but for society
              as a whole (yeah, yeah, I know that can be debated but it's how the
              character is written). The Punisher is guided by a very strict set of
              ethics. He truly believes he is making the world a better place. (That's
              the white part.) But he feels he is above the law and he accomplishes
              his task as he sees fit most often by blowing the bad guys away. (That's
              the red part.)</p>

            <p><img src="Disorderly%20Conduct_files/mtgcom_daily_mr205_pic2_en.jpg"><b>The
                A Team</b>
              – As you can see vigilantes feel right at home in red/white. The A Team
              is no exception. The A Team is out to do good. They have a strong moral
              center and are clearly guided by the desire to right wrongs. That said,
              they are in no way constrained by anyone else's rules. They do what it
              takes to accomplish their task (and other than BA getting shot every
              eighth episode no one ever seems to get hurt).</p>

            <p><b>Worf</b> – Worf is a Klingon (heavy red) raised by humans (heavy
              white). He has great respect for structure as a member of the Federation
              yet still understands the primal emotions that guide his people. His
              whole character is based on the internal conflict of these two forces.</p>

            <p><b>V from <i>V for Vendetta</i></b> – This is another comic book
              reference (and a good one at that – way better than the Punisher in my
              comic tastes – although to be fair Garth Ennis does write a mean
              Punisher). I chose it for two reasons. One, the movie (with Natalie
              Portman) is coming out soon so hopefully this reference will make sense
              to more people within the next year. Second, he is the best example of a
              character that flip flops the means and ends. V is trying to create
              anarchy and chaos but through very tight and structured means.</p>
