            <p>Welcome to Sultai Week! This week, we'll be talking all about the
              Black-Green-Blue wedge. As this is the fourth of five clan weeks, I'll
              be continuing my look at how the three colors from each clan get along.
              To do this, I'll put all three colors in a room together and interview
              them. I've previously interviewed the colors from <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mm/we-will-survive-2014-09-29"
                target="_blank">Abzan</a>, <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mm/smart-thinking-2014-11-03"
                target="_blank">Jeskai</a>, and <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/finishing-first-2014-11-17"
                target="_blank">Mardu</a>. If you are interested in reading more about the color philosophies, you can
              check out my <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/color-pie" target="_blank">color pie page</a>
              where I talk about the topic at great length (in more than 20 articles).</p>



            <p>My goal with the wedge series is to help you all get a better sense
              of how the colors interact and what they think about one another. I'll
              ask questions and then get out of the way. As I've said my required
              explanation, let's get to the interview:</p>



            <p><strong>Hello, colors. As always, I'm going to start by having each
                color introduce itself. We'll go in the order you all appear in the mana
                cost of a Sultai card.</strong></p>



            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana_002.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm Black. I'm about achieving power through opportunity and apparently I'm forced to say this every
              interview.</p>





            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm Green. I'm about achieving acceptance through wisdom. Unlike Black, I am more than happy to repeat
              rituals.</p>





            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Rituals, I like.</p>



            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm Blue. I'm about achieving perfection through knowledge.</p>





            <p><strong>I always like to start by talking about the attribute the
                clan represents. Sultai is about ruthlessness. Could you each talk about
                what ruthlessness means to you?</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You do understand this is the fourth time you've done this? I'm not
              sure sticking to the same routine is the best way to make this
              entertaining. I have some ideas how we could spice this up.</p>





            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Black is correct that the anticipation of surprise can often create
              an adrenaline rush in the audience. There is something inherently
              thrilling about not being able to anticipate where something is going.
              Of course, if you take the time to evaluate the cues being provided, you
              can often plot out the most logical path.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We're not changing anything. This interview structure is sound and
              proven. We can take comfort in this being the fourth time because we can
              look back and see how successful the previous interviews have gone.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>As Red likes to say, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Why are you quoting Red? Oh, I see what's going on here. You're trying to change things to annoy me.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm trying to change things because I can. If it annoys you, that's just an extra bonus.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Is that your recurring theme, changing things just for the sake of changing them?</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I find the tone of your voice interesting every time you say the word
              "change." It's as if you find it to be a repugnant idea. Last I
              checked, nature changes all the time.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No, nature evolves. It's a slow, gradual change over time. What you
              and Black are talking about is quick, sudden changes made solely to
              satisfy some egotistical drive to show that you exist in the world.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Here's what I don't understand, Green: Whenever someone does
              something the way they want it, it's unnatural and disruptive, but
              whenever you do the things you want, it's part of the natural order. I
              like how you define the world such that the way you want to live is the
              only proper way.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>If it isn't broke, you don't fix it.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But there's always room for improvement. Just because something works
              doesn't mean that something else might not work better. And how are you
              going to know that without experimentation?</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Maro asked us our thoughts on ruthlessness. We should talk about that.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>This is a freeform interview. Rosewater said he'd "get out of the
              way." We can answer however we wish. I want to talk about your
              pathological fear of change.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm not afraid of change.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You're the enemy of both Black and myself, and the core overlap
              between us is the belief that you have the ability to steer the course
              of your own life.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Your life is already on a path. You don't have to steer anything. Just follow the path.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But what if I don't like the path? What if I want a different path?</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>There isn't even a singular path. It's a giant network of constantly splitting paths.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Heaven forbid, the world be simple. You have this insatiable desire to create complexity where there
              doesn't need to be any.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But if I have a desire, isn't that an internally generated feeling. Weren't I born with it?</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You can mock me all you want. The difference between us is I know the true path.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>All this talk about paths. What is life, the yellow brick road? You
              follow it to find the answer to all your problems? That worked out so
              well for Dorothy.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>She got home.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Not because of the yellow brick road. She got home because she took
              matters into her own hands. If she hadn't killed the Wicked Witch would
              she have ever gotten back to Kansas?</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>She got home because the power to do so was always within her.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm pretty sure it was the ruby slippers, which interestingly in the
              original book by Frank L. Baum, were silver slippers. You see, they
              represented the silver standard in contrast to the gold standard
              symbolized by the yellow brick road. It turns out the book was an
              allegory for a late nineteenth-century debate regarding monetary policy.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Blue!</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Sorry. My point was that Dorothy's triumph was the result of an external force—i.e., her slippers.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But metaphorically, the author was trying to make the point that her
              ability to solve her problems was something she had had throughout the
              entire story. She had to search within, not without.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You want to understand what ruthlessness is. Ruthlessness is being
              willing to take action to get what you want. The difference between
              being a victim and being in control of your life is simply the
              willingness to do what needs to be done. And that requires the
              willingness to embrace change when necessary.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Exactly. Personal growth comes from the conscious choice of taking actions to promote change.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Ruthlessness isn't about change. It's about accepting who you are and having the guts to be true to your
              nature.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Can we at least agree that it's the willingness to do what needs to get done?</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Yes.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Fine.</p>





            <p><strong>Let's talk about what mechanical tools you three have for a strategy of ruthlessness.</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Blue and I are willing to do something none of the other colors
              are—go after the opponent's mind, represented by the hand and library.
              Blue has counterspells. I have discard. Blue has milling. I have spells
              that extract cards directly out of the library.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I guess Black and I are both willing to destroy things. Black kills
              creatures, lands, and Planeswalkers, while I will destroy everything but
              creatures.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I, and Black on rare occasion, are willing to steal things. I also redirect spells. Attack opponents
              with their own resources.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm willing to pay whatever additional costs I need to get effects.
              Pay life, sacrifice creatures, discard cards—whatever, I'll do it.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Black and I, and Blue a little with spells, are willing to bring things back from the graveyard.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>In general, we're the colors willing to do whatever it takes to win.
              We'll cut off your resources, go after whatever element of the game we
              have to, steal things, use the dead. Not a lot is off limits with us.</p>





            <p><strong>Green, why don't we talk a little more about what it's like for you to work with your two
                enemies.</strong></p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I think the biggest problem I have is that it's hard to work with two colors that you pity.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p><em>You</em> pity <em>us</em>? Us? I believe you're supposed to pity the fool. That's you.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's hard when you see the answer to watch others struggle so much to find it.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You and White just love making stuff up. Tell me more about this mystical force that guides the
              universe.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm not sure what I can say. You both are nonbelievers.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>We're nonbelievers because there is no empirical proof of what you are claiming exists.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's not something you know, it's something you believe. Not everything is quantifiable.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Well, it's very convenient that what you believe in cannot be proved. It makes it impossible to disprove
              it.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's not about proving or disproving. It's about examining the world around you.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You don't examine the world around you. You do the exact opposite.
              You huddle up with what you know and then turn away from anything that
              contradicts that world view. You want to know how Black and I know about
              the world? We study it. We live in it. We experience it. Black is
              right. You're afraid of change. You're afraid of accepting that all your
              strongly held beliefs might not actually be true.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>That's my biggest problem. You keep talking about destiny and your
              role in the world. Nothing gets to dictate who you are or what you are
              capable of doing. The only things that can stop you are your own
              limitations or someone more powerful than you preventing it.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm sad that that's the world you choose to live in.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>It's not the world I choose. It's the world that is. That's the
              problem with all you other colors, although less so for you Blue.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Noted.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You live in denial. You refuse to accept the world as it is. I didn't, for example, make people greedy.
              They <em>are</em>
              greedy. I just chose to act in a way that takes it into account. You
              know why I think it's okay to kill someone else? Because I know if I
              don't there's a chance that person is going to kill me, and if I'm not
              the one proactive about it, I'll be the one dead. Note that I don't just
              going around wantonly killing people. I kill only when necessary.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I guess your penance is you have to live in a world where you believe that to be true.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You keep stating things as if they're facts when there is no data to support your claims.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>No data? Just look around you? Walk into a forest. Climb a mountain.
              Dive under water. You are literally surrounded by nature, by life.
              You're all about observation, Blue. The things I'm talking about can be
              observed.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I admit there's a structure to nature. That doesn't mean it's optimized. That doesn't mean it can't be
              improved upon.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>And I'm the one making statements that can't be proven?</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You want proof? How about tools. Humans have made tools that allow us to do things better than without
              them.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Do you think a swan cares about how much harder you can hit a nail?</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>What?! It's like you're talking in badly constructed haikus. Who cares about swans? Why is Green talking
              about swans?!</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>If I understand correctly, Green is trying to counter my argument
              about tools by saying that they grant us advantage but not one that
              matters in the larger scale.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Exactly.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I call bull. One whole subset of tools is weapons and weapons clearly change the balance of power.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So humans fight with other humans. What does that mean to a gazelle?</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Gazelle? Do you have some hidden wheel where you just randomly
              produce animal names? You know the problem here. Blue and I are trying
              to make it a better world while you're content to do nothing.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You kill people. How is that making it a better world?</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The same reason you prune a plant. Healthy things thrive when you cut away the weak. Check it out, I
              made a nature metaphor.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Duly impressed.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>As far as I'm concerned, you're a fraud. You keep trying to sell a bill of goods that doesn't add up.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Says the thirsty man wading in a stream.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Blue, you do the talking. I'm pretty sure Rosewater will get pissed if I kill Green.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Tag team it is. So Green, do you understand how disheartening the
              concept of destiny is? The idea that nothing you do matters because
              everything that's relevant to your future has already been determined.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Disheartening or enlightening? Too many people spend their time
              fighting their nature rather than using it productively. I don't think
              you understand the weight that is lifted off your shoulders when you
              realize that your role has already been determined. So much stress comes
              from people try to live up to some unattainable ideal.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But out of that stress comes productivity. And that productivity over the long haul leads to
              improvement.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>But does it?</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Okay, I think I understand Green's arguing format. Make a bold and true statement.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Two plus two is four.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>True; not so bold, but good enough. Okay, say it again.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Two plus two is four.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Unless it's not. You see, no matter what's said, Green diffuses it by
              stating the other side as an empiric truth that cannot be questioned
              because its defense is about things that cannot be measured.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'm trying to show you the light. Life has a purpose and it's all
              spelled out for you if you would just stop seeing it as some quest to
              gain more power.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>So people can't improve themselves because nothing will alter them
              from their preordained path? Why bother gaining knowledge or training or
              experiences? It's just going to pull you away from your true calling.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'd feel better if you didn't always state my philosophies with sarcasm.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>I'd feel better if we could say them without having to be sarcastic.
              Look, let's cut to the chase. I actually admire you Green. You've taken
              laziness and raised it to a whole new level. "Let's not do anything
              because we might miss our genes telling us what we're supposed to be
              doing." And you've done so by wrapping yourself in a system of answers
              that have no checks and balances. They're true because you say they are.
              Well, guess what? I don't believe you. I believe you made up an
              elaborate series of lies as a means to avoid having to face any hard
              truths about life.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>You act as if I had a hand in the making of nature. You keeping
              saying we have to accept the world for what it is. Well, that also goes
              for nature itself. Everyone's so busy looking for ways to change nature
              that people overlook that perhaps it's not the nature that needs the
              changing.</p>





            <p><strong>Obviously, Blue and Black, you have some issues with Green. I'm curious, what conflicts do the
                two of you have?</strong></p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The key to understanding the conflict of allies is you have to start
              by looking at the two other allies of those two colors. For me and
              Black, that's White and Red. The key conflict of White versus Red is one
              of Order vs. Chaos. I lean toward the orderly side of White while Black
              leans toward the chaotic side of Red. I want to have a plan. I want to
              know what I'm up against and prepare. Black is much more of a "roll with
              the punches" kind of color. It's nowhere near as reckless as Red, but
              Black is a little too willing to accept risks.</p>







            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>My biggest issue with Blue is its unwillingness to be more proactive.
              Everything's about being reactive. Blue has to always wait and see what
              happens before making any moves.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>My biggest issue is Black's willingness to do just about anything to
              get what it wants. There are lines the other colors draw and those lines
              exist for a reason. They help mark who we are as a society and as a
              people. Black seems to cross the lines half the time just to prove that
              it's within Black's power to be able to do so.</p>





            <p><strong>It looks like we've used up all our time, so I'll end just as
                I have for all the other interviews and ask for each of you to give me a
                short, pithy pitch of one sentence why people should play Sultai. As
                always, we'll go in the order of your introductions.</strong></p>





            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/blackmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The person who wins the battle is the one more willing to do what it takes to win.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/greenmana.jpg"></p>

            <p>Nature has no limits to what it is capable of doing.</p>









            <p><img src="Whatever%20It%20Takes_files/bluemana.jpg"></p>

            <p>The most dangerous warrior is one who understands what he or she is capable of doing.</p>
