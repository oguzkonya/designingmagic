              <p><img>Welcome to Selesnya Week. For those keeping count, this is actually the second Selesnya Week.
                During the original <i>Ravnica</i> block, we had ten guild theme weeks and for <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                block, we're doing it again. It's always a challenge to revisit theme
                weeks, because I already wrote the first article that came to my mind
                the last time we had the theme week. But I'm always up for a challenge.
                You can see all ten guild weeks along with my articles on color
                philosophy <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Features.aspx?tag=Color%20Pie">here</a>.
                (My guild theme week articles were about the color philosophy of the
                two colors in question, along with the philosophy of the guild itself.)</p>
              <p>As
                I spent the last batch of guild theme weeks talking about color
                philosophy, I thought I would spend the theme weeks this time talking
                about guild design. Today, for example, I am going to talk about how to
                design for green-white in the abstract and Selesnya in particular. I'll
                also look at the two guild mechanics (from original <i>Ravnica</i> block and <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                block) to go a little more in depth as to how they were designed and
                what needs the mechanics had. Hopefully, that sounds like fun.</p>
              <p>To
                keep things orderly (I will be doing this for ten weeks, after all), I
                thought I would structure these columns by asking the same sets of
                questions for each guild/color pairing.</p>

              <h3>What's the Easiest Thing About This Color Pairing?</h3>
              <p>For
                green-white, the answer is that the colors blend together easily. Of
                all the colors in the game, the green-white color pairing is the
                closest. Green and white, for example, are the two most creature-centric
                colors. This means they are #1 and #2 (white, then green) as far as who
                gets the most creatures. The two share lifegain, creature boosting,
                enchantment (and, to a lesser extent for white, artifact) removal,
                vigilance, damage prevention (with green's being <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Fog">Fog</a>
                effects), adding +1/+1 counters, untapping creatures, and other small effects.</p>
              <p>Green
                and white are not only the closest colors mechanically but also
                philosophically. Selesnya, for example, plays into the fact that these
                two colors are the colors of community. They both like to form large
                bands of creatures and overrun their enemies. Yes, white is more the
                army color, hitting fast with small creatures working together, while
                green ramps up its mana to get a horde of larger creatures onto the
                battlefield, but the two have a similar feel.</p>
              <p>Also, in future
                weeks I'll talk about how certain color pairings are close in one area
                but distant in another. Green and white, in contrast, are similar to one
                another through almost every card type.</p>
              <h3>What's the Hardest Thing About This Color Pairing?</h3>
              <p>One
                of my favorite sayings is "Your greatest weakness is just your greatest
                strength pushed too far." This similarity between green and white is
                good in finding synergies but also causes problems because it's harder
                to find multicolor cards that truly feel like they are green<i> and</i> white, rather than being green<i>
                  or </i>white.
                In other words, green-white is the king of hybrid design where you're
                looking for overlap, but is problematic when you want strong definition
                to mix and match.</p>
              <p>Ramp;D has spent a lot of time making fine-tuned
                adjustments between what green gets and what white gets. As an example,
                white gets lesser creature boosts (+2/+2 and smaller), while green gets
                greater creature boosts (+3/+3 and larger). The fact that we've spent
                so much time splitting hairs between the colors means it's harder for
                each color to have clear color identity. For example, you can't make the
                white part of a green-white card grant a +2/+2 boost, because even
                though it's technically white it feels too close to green.</p>

              <h3>What's the Mechanical Heart of This Color Pair?</h3>
              <p>To
                answer this question, I must first define my terms. A mechanical heart
                is at the center of a design. It's the thing that defines what must be
                built around. For example, the mechanical heart of the original <i>Ravnica</i>
                design was the guilds. At every point, we used the emphasis on the
                guilds to create the framework for the design. It led to how the colors
                were used. It led to how the keywords were defined. It led to all the
                key decisions of the design.</p>
              <p>Now, when I talk about the mechanical
                design of a color pair, I'm referring to what is the one mechanical
                element that most defines the interrelation between the two colors. For
                green and white, this is creatures. Both colors are focused on creatures
                and both colors define much of their philosophy and mechanics around
                supporting creatures.</p>
              <p>If creatures are the mechanical heart, that
                means that the definition of green-white (and extra so in Selesnya) has
                to be found in the creatures. In other words, the guild keyword, which
                is going to be the strongest marker for the guild's mechanical feel, has
                to be on and about creatures.</p>
              <h3>What's the Focus of This Color Pair?</h3>
              <p>The
                mechanical heart is about which part of the design has to be the
                build-around component. For green-white, that's creatures. The focus is
                more about what the color combination wants to do to win. Okay,
                green-white is focused on creatures. Wonderful. Now how is it going to
                use its creatures to win?</p>
              <p>The answer was hinted at above. Green
                and white are both about overwhelming the opponent with creatures. White
                does it quicker than green, but both have a similar play style. This
                means the focus of green-white is a creature-based attack strategy that
                relies on having a number of creatures. The focus is another thing that
                has to play into the guild keyword. If green-white is about attacking
                with creatures, then its guild mechanic has to help in that goal.</p>
              <h3>Convoke</h3>
              <p><img src="Designing%20for%20Selesnya_files/mm215_3_cards.jpg" alt="" width="620"></p>
              <p>We'll begin with Selesnya's first guild mechanic, convoke. Convoke was designed by <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Richard%20Garfield">Richard
                  Garfield</a>,
                interestingly enough, for the Boros guild. Richard felt that it
                conveyed the sense of the army working together to strengthen the unit.
                Richard called it crittercast. I enjoyed crittercast but told Richard I
                thought he had put it into the wrong guild. I'd been looking for a
                creature-centered mechanic for Selesnya and crittercast fit the bill
                perfectly.</p>
              <p>For starters, convoke is a mechanic that requires
                creatures yet doesn't only go on creatures. In addition, it greatly
                rewards players having a lot of creatures. That is very much the
                identity we wanted with Selesnya. In addition, it lines up beautifully
                with the philosophy of the guild, as green and white's overlap is very
                much about the value of community. Selesnya's strength in the story is
                that it is the most selfless of the guilds. Its guild members consider
                each other equals and want to work together.</p>
              <p>Convoke did a
                wonderful job of conveying a sense of closeness between the creatures
                because they have to work together to cast spells. Also, it did a good
                job of helping green-white get out bigger creatures faster to help their
                route to victory. Remember that the cost reduction wasn't solely about
                getting out big creatures. It also allowed a player from Selesnya to
                cast spells without requiring mana. These types of spells tended to be
                cheap, to maximize the amount of times they can be used for "free."</p>
              <p>Early
                plotting is all well and good, but at some point you have to actually
                make the cards with the mechanic. It's at this point that you start to
                explore how much design space a mechanic can support. Let me quickly
                explain what you're looking for in this area:</p>
              <p><b>1.</b><b>How many different card types can this mechanic go on?</b></p>
              <p>For each additional card type a mechanic can be used on, you're opening up more space.</p>
              <p><b>2.</b><b>Does it require any restrictions?</b></p>
              <p>One
                of the biggest limiters of design space is simply self-limitations by
                the mechanic itself. Does the mechanic require targeting? Does it
                require a variable number? Does it require an ability that can be
                tweaked? Many mechanics get locked down because there is simply a small
                list of things that fit the card's mechanical requirements.</p>
              <p><b>3.</b><b>Does the mechanic fight with itself for space?</b></p>
              <p>Another
                big problem is when a mechanic fights for a resource with other cards
                with the same mechanic. For example, we've been trying to find a home
                for <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;text=+%5bdelve%5damp;set=+%5b%22Future+Sight%22%5d">delve
                  from <i>Future Sight</i></a><i>.</i>
                One of delve's biggest issues is that it's hard to put too many in your
                deck because each one wants to eat up your graveyard, leaving no food
                for future delve cards. When this happens, it forces the designers to
                lessen how many cards they make with the mechanic.</p>
              <p>One of
                convoke's greatest strengths was that it didn't cause any of these
                problems. It could go on any card type, it didn't have any real
                restrictions, and it didn't fight with itself. In fact, with the last
                issue it went the opposite way. The enablers for convoke worked well
                with all convoke cards, often encouraging you to play with more convoke.</p>
              <p>Of the original ten <i>Ravnica</i> guild mechanics, I believe convoke was the strongest design with
                the most potential for future use.</p>

                  Hamm</a></p>
              <h3>Populate</h3>
              <p>One of the things we tried with the new guild keywords in <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                was to find ways to make a new keyword that wasn't simply retreading
                what the first guild mechanic had done. Convoke did a wonderful job, but
                we needed to find a different way to attack the problem. Obviously, the
                mechanic had to be creature-centered, but other than that we were free
                to explore any design space.</p>
              <p>I felt like in <i>Ravnica</i>,
                Selesnya had explored the idea of creatures helping one another. I was
                interested in focusing more on the explosive nature of creatures in
                green-white. Selesnya's victory plan is to overwhelm the opponent with
                creatures. What if the new Selesnya guild mechanic helped with this
                explosion?</p>
              <p>The first place my mind went was this card:</p>
              <div>
                <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Chant"><img src="Designing%20for%20Selesnya_files/Image.jpg"
                      alt=""></a></p>
              </div>
              <p>Could
                we make a mechanic out of this? No, it was a little too much. Could we
                tone it down? That's when I stumbled upon the idea of a proliferate for
                creature tokens. <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/212">As
                  I've explained</a>,
                the first version was pretty much just that—it made a copy of each type
                of token. If you had two 1/1s, a 2/2, and two 3/3s, the spell would
                make a new 1/1, a new 2/2, and a new 3/3. I believe that version lasted
                for one playtest before it got changed to its current version. It was
                both too strong and created a weird incentive for deck building—you
                wanted to have as many different types of tokens as possible.</p>
              <p>The
                interesting thing about populate is that, even though we cracked the
                mechanic during the first few weeks of design, populate caused a lot of
                headaches because it's what I call a two-tier mechanic. Let me explain.
                Some mechanics live on their own. That is, they don't require the
                interaction of any other card, or, if they do, what is being asked is
                something that <b>Magic </b>regularly provides.</p>
              <p>A two-tier
                mechanic, though, requires some other element to exist in the set. In
                the case of populate, that second tier is token creatures. As
                second-tiers go, this one isn't too bad. The game naturally has tokens
                and green and white are the two colors that tend to create the most
                tokens. (Mass token generation used to be primary green and secondary
                white, but that got swapped when we decided to push harder on white
                being the army color—this is also when we changed it so white got the
                most creatures at common.)</p>
              <p>Usually, the second tier has to be able
                to stand on its own, otherwise it becomes what we call parasitic (i.e.,
                it only works with other things from the same set). Selesnya required
                us to up the overall number of tokens, but as they work fine in
                isolation we felt comfortable ramping it up. We felt that it would give
                Selesnya a stronger feel without severely handicapping the set. (Note
                that this did mean we had to be a little more cautious with the cards
                that are the natural enemies of token creatures—bounce spells, I'm
                looking at you.)</p>
              <p>Populate ended up having two major problems. One,
                the populate part of the two-tier system was parasitic. It didn't mean
                anything without the other piece. Luckily, tokens are a strong part of <b>Magic</b>'s
                past, so although populate is parasitic it was at least parasitic with a
                lot of already-existing cards. Two, common populate cards had the
                problem of stranding players with populate cards without tokens.</p>
              <p>The
                first problem we knew we had to suck up but the second one had some
                work-arounds. The most common trick we did was to make the populate
                cards themselves create tokens, ensuring there was always something to
                populate. The other common trick was to use populate as a rider. That
                way, if you didn't have a token in play, the card still had a function.</p>
              <p>The
                end result of all this is that populate ended up having less design
                space than convoke. That's not a bad thing, as one of the biggest
                advantages of the guild system is that we can make use of mechanics that
                aren't quite big enough to be a showcase mechanic (a major high-focus
                mechanic of a set). Because we had fewer populate cards overall, we made
                sure to have a bunch of the higher rarity ones be repeatable. This
                would help increase the amount of populating going on during a game.</p>
              <p>Populate
                was definitely a bigger pain to design, and design around, than
                convoke, but I'm very happy with how it turned out. Selesnya, due in a
                big part to populate, is my favorite guild to play in <i>Return to Ravnica</i>. (It's not my favorite
                in the block, but we'll get there soon enough.)</p>

              <h3>Any Final Thoughts?</h3>
              <p>The
                joy of designing guilds is capturing the purity of the guild's message.
                I'm very happy how we managed to make Selesnya creature-centric in <i>Return to Ravnica</i> but in a
                way different from the original <i>Ravnica</i>.
                I've mentioned how one of our goals was to make sure the new version of
                the guild felt unique but still blended nicely with what was done
                before.</p>
              <p>I like how convoke and populate hit different notes but
                are still working toward the same goal. This means when you mix the
                watermarks from original Selesnya with the new Selesnya, you get a
                combination of cards that work together and create a unified feel.</p>
