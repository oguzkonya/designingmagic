              <p>Welcome to Azorius Week. This is the second of our guild theme weeks for <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                block. (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/node/656456">Selesnya Week</a>
                was about a month back.) As I explained during Selesnya Week, we had a
                series of ten guild theme weeks during the original Ravnica block (you
                can see all my guild columns <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/features.aspx?tag=color%20pie">here</a>)
                where I talked about the color philosophy of each guild. This time out,
                I'm talking about what it takes to design for each color pair in
                general and for the guild specifically.</p>

                  Baker</a></p>

              <p>I've chosen to make these ten weeks orderly by asking the same
                questions of each guild and then talking in depth about the design of
                the two guild mechanics, the one from Ravnica block and the one from <i>Return to Ravnica</i> block.
                Let's get started.</p>

              <h3>What's the Easiest Thing About This Color Pairing?</h3>

              <p>Both white and blue have a very defensive nature. As such, both their
                creatures are a bit more on the defensive side (they are the two
                colors, for example, that most often have toughness greater than power),
                they tend to have more controlling qualities (for instance, tapping
                creatures as a creature-activated effect is white and blue—blue usually
                also untaps them), and they often have evasion (for example, white and
                blue are the top two colors at flying).</p>

              <p>When it comes to spells, white and blue have the most reactive cards.
                White tends to protect itself and its creatures while blue fiddles with
                the natures of magic, countering spells and the like, but the two have a
                similar feel in that they often sit back and wait for the opponent to
                act first. In mechanics overlap, white is closer to green, but in
                overall feel, white is closer to blue. It's not hard to get each color
                to push toward the other.</p>

                  Rapoza</a></p>

              <h3>What's the Hardest Thing About This Color Pairing?</h3>

              <p>While white and blue each have a defensive aspect that aligns
                perfectly with the other, they both have a more aggressive side that
                doesn't match up quite as well. White has a weenie attack strategy
                (blue, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Delver+of+Secrets">Delver
                  of Secrets</a>
                notwithstanding, traditionally has the weakest weenie creatures) while
                blue has a tempo style of play that white can't add a lot to. What this
                means is that the overlap between the two colors has to concentrate on a
                smaller sliver of design space than some of the other color
                combinations.</p>

              <p>Also, the area that the two mesh the best in—the "sit back and be
                reactive, preventing everything from happening" style of play—is not the
                most fun <b>Magic</b>, so development is reluctant to push it,
                powerwise. This means design is always on the lookout for cards in
                white-blue that feel good yet don't make the game screech to a halt.</p>

              <h3>What's the Mechanical Heart of This Color Pair?</h3>

              <p>From a color-pie philosophy, white and blue are the two colors that
                plan ahead most, white with its orderly strategizing and blue with its
                thoughtful reflection. This means that the key to white-blue is control
                of the game. Note that I mean control in the broader sense and just not
                counterspells (although that is one of the things blue brings to the
                white-blue table).</p>

              <p>White and blue want to take control of every facet of the game they
                can. They want to dictate what the things on the battlefield can and
                cannot do. They want to control how and what gets played. They want to
                grant themselves options while taking away options from the opponent.
                When designing white-blue, and Azorius in particular, the designers have
                to always ask, "What is white-blue doing to push the game toward its
                agenda?"</p>

              <p>This means there are a lot of reactive and proactive cards. This
                means things on the battlefield like to either affect other things or be
                unable to be affected by other things. White-blue wants to set the
                rules.</p>

              <h3>What's the Focus of This Color Pair?</h3>

              <p>Controlling the game is a good strategy but it doesn't tend to win.
                Part of having a focus is having a route to victory. For white-blue,
                this route is through creatures. There are two different ways that
                white-blue uses creatures to win.</p>

              <p>First is the evasion strategy. As I said above, white and blue are
                the top two colors for creatures with flying. White also has protection
                while blue has unblockability and islandwalk. White-blue's strategy is
                to take control of the game and then use its evasive creatures to peck
                away at the opponent. White then uses protective spells while blue uses
                permission and hexproof to keep these evasive creatures safe.</p>

              <p>Second is the big flier strategy. Both white and blue get big fliers,
                especially at higher rarities—most iconically Angels and Sphinxes. A
                different way to win is to get a large flier out in the mid- to late
                game and then protect it while it single-handedly wins the game.</p>

              <p>Regardless of the choice, control + creatures + protection of those creatures leads to a white-blue
                and Azorius victory.</p>

              <h3>Forecast</h3>

              <p><img src="Designing%20for%20Azorius_files/mm219_forecast.jpg"></p>
              &nbsp;

              <p>Let me begin by explaining where the <i>Dissension</i> design team (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=aaron%20forsythe">Aaron
                  Forsythe</a> as lead, with <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=mark%20gottlieb">Mark
                  Gottlieb</a>, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=brandon%20bozzi">Brandon
                  Bozzi</a>,
                and myself) was when we designed forecast. From time to time, the head
                developer comes to me and explains that some deck is doing well and
                could design please not push in a certain area? Right before <i>Dissension</i> started, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=brian%20schneider">Brian
                  Schneider</a>, the head developer during the <i>Ravnica</i>
                block, came to me and said that white-blue control had gotten a little
                stronger than he was comfortable with. Could we avoid pushing in that
                direction in <i>Dissension</i>?</p>

              <p>Look up above where I talk about the mechanical heart of white-blue.
                Brian basically asked the design team to make Azorius without, you know,
                playing up its defensive nature (i.e., use its mechanical heart). Brian
                did understand the awkwardness of what he was asking and he wouldn't
                have asked if it wasn't important, so we did our best to make Azorius
                feel like white-blue without pushing the control aspect too hard.</p>

              <p>Our solution to this problem was to play more into what I listed as
                the focus above. We played up the flying aspect of Azorius and made the
                guild a little more aggressive. I feel Azorius was the guild of all ten
                in the original <i>Ravnica</i> block that deviated the most from
                expectation, but now you know that was because we needed to avoid the
                obvious answer. As you will see, we corrected this problem in <i>Return to Ravnica</i>.</p>

              <p>So, we were looking for a mechanic that felt Azorius but wasn't super
                defensive. For some reason, my mind went to a card that wasn't white <i>or</i> blue. Can you guess the
                card that inspired me to come up with the forecast mechanic?</p>

              <p>Think about it. When you're ready <u> <span color="blue">click here</span> </u>.</p>

              <div id="spawn">
                <div>
                  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil"><img
                        alt="Infernal Spawn of Evil" src="Designing%20for%20Azorius_files/Image_002.jpg"></a></p>
                </div>
                &nbsp;

                <p>How many of your minds went to <i>Unglued</i>? Before I explain how <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil"
                    data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil">Infernal
                    Spawn of Evil</a> inspired forecast, let me start by explaining how the card got designed in the
                  first place. Many years ago, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;amp;method=visual&amp;amp;action=advanced&amp;amp;artist=%5b%22ron+spencer%22%5d">Ron
                    Spencer</a>
                  was assigned some gruesome black card. Normally, before artists paint
                  their illustrations, they send in sketches so the art director can make
                  sure they're going in the right direction.</p>

                <p>Ron Spencer had been assigned some gruesome black card and as a joke sent in a sketch that looked a
                  lot like the art of <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil"
                    data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil">Infernal
                    Spawn of Evil</a>. Everyone had a good laugh and then Ron sent in the real sketch. While working on
                  <i>Unglued</i>,
                  I decided I wanted to use the original sketch Ron made. I decided the
                  joke of the card was that this was the most evil creature in the world.
                  The name <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil"
                    data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil">Infernal
                    Spawn of Evil</a> was chosen to play up this joke.</p>

                <p>While designing the card, I wanted to find a mechanic that played up
                  the flavor that this creature was so scary that even the mere hint it
                  would eventually appear was enough to scare opponents—scare them enough
                  that it physically hurt them and made them lose life. After playing
                  around with a few ideas I ended up with the idea that you could show the
                  card from your hand once per turn. The card had to be expensive because
                  it was supposed to be big and scary in play and this ability would
                  allow you to do something with it until you could cast it.</p>

                <p>Okay, that's how <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil"
                    data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil">Infernal
                    Spawn of Evil</a> got made. How exactly did my search for a white-blue mechanic get me to a black
                  <i>Unglued</i>
                  card? Looking back, here's my best guess as to what happened:
                  White-blue tends to like having cards in hand. That got me to thinking
                  about cards that had a function while in your hand. That line of
                  thinking got me to <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil"
                    data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil">Infernal
                    Spawn of Evil</a>, the one card in <b>Magic</b> 's past that did exactly that.</p>
              </div>

              <p>What if, I suggested, we had a mechanic that lived in the hand so
                that white-blue had something to do with its handful of cards? The idea
                with the mechanic was that it would generate a small effect. This would
                allow the player to choose between repeatedly getting a small effect or
                casting the card for a one-time large effect.</p>

              <p>The mechanic was very choice heavy but I felt like the style of
                player attracted to Azorius would actually appreciate the choice and
                would have fun trying to figure out when to abandon the small forecast
                effect for the larger spell effect.</p>

              <p>Once the team accepted forecast as an idea for the guild mechanic,
                the next step was figuring out how to properly execute it. Originally,
                the plan was to have the cards trigger at upkeep, but the rules don't
                like triggers originated from a non-public zone (i.e., a place all
                players can't see). In the end, we ended up making it an activated
                ability but one restricted to your upkeep.</p>

              <p>The bigger design issue was figuring out how to design the forecast
                cards such that the forecast effect seemed a natural part of the card.
                In the end, we ended up with three main ways to do this:</p>

              <p><b>The Combo</b>: Some of the cards, such as <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pride+of+the+Clouds"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Pride+of+the+Clouds">Pride
                  of the Clouds</a>, have a forecast effect that has synergy with the spell effect. For example, if you
                use the forecast on <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pride+of+the+Clouds"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Pride+of+the+Clouds">Pride
                  of the Clouds</a> to make a flying Bird token, when you cast <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pride+of+the+Clouds"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Pride+of+the+Clouds">Pride
                  of the Clouds</a> it is +1/+1 larger. On these cards, the two effects are linked only by how they
                work together.</p>

              <p><b>The Lesser Effect</b>: Other forecast cards have a forecast effect
                that is basically a smaller version of the spell effect. An example of
                this would be <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyscribing"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Skyscribing">Skyscribing</a>.
                <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyscribing" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Skyscribing">Skyscribing</a>
                can use forecast to allow all players to draw a card. If you play the spell it will allow all players
                to draw X cards.</p>

              <p><b>The Ability Sharing</b>: This last example can be seen on <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+en-Dal"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spirit+en-Dal">Spirit
                  <i>en</i>-Dal</a>. The forecast effect is to grant target creature the ability the creature naturally
                has, such as shadow on <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+en-Dal"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Spirit+en-Dal">Spirit
                  <i>en</i>-Dal</a>, to a target creature for the turn.</p>

              <p>Ideally, all of the cards would have been the first category, as from
                a design aesthetic, the combo was the most satisfying. The second type
                came about because we simply couldn't make that many clean combo
                versions. The final category came into play because it was very hard to
                do the second category on creatures.</p>

              <p>With 20/20 hindsight, I think forecast was merely a fair mechanic. It
                was a bit of a stretch for Azorius, flavorwise, especially given that
                we had shifted away from a more controlling style that would have
                synergized more with forecast. Second, the mechanic was very restrictive
                and I don't feel all the cards were able to meet the standard set by <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pride+of+the+Clouds"

                  of the Clouds</a>.</p>

              <p>The final issue with it is a common R&amp;amp;D issue called
                repetitive game play. In general, we tend to shy away from mechanics
                that make the same thing happen every turn. Constant repetition simply
                makes the game less fun and lowers the variance that is one of <b>Magic</b>'s strengths.</p>

              <p>All in all, I feel like forecast was a B-, which is lower than I like
                to hit with mechanics. Luckily, when we returned seven years later, we
                fared a little better.</p>

              <h3>Detain</h3>

              <p>The very first meeting we had for <i>Return to Ravnica</i> design (the team was <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=kenneth%20nagle">Ken
                  Nagle</a> as the lead, Alexis Jansen, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=ken%20troop">Ken
                  Troop</a>, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=zac%20hill">Zac Hill</a>,
                and myself) started by Ken saying the following: "Last time, Azorius
                wasn't really what you expected white-blue to be. We're going to fix
                that problem this time."</p>

              <p>For those who don't remember, after we broke down the possible guild splits for <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                and <i>Gatecrash</i>, we ended up with two choices. I had already had a chance to work on most of the
                guilds in <i>Ravnica</i> block (remember, I was the lead for <i>Gatecrash</i>—I
                later ended up handing over the reins halfway through to Mark Gottlieb)
                so I let Ken pick which combination of guilds he wanted. Ken chose the <i>Return to Ravnica</i> mix
                partly, he said, because he wanted to do Azorius right.</p>

              <p>The first idea we had for Azorius came from me. I too wanted to
                capture Azorius correctly and had an interesting idea how to do that. In
                the end, though, my idea had two problems.</p>

              <p>One, it was too insular. Knowing the guilds are going to be drafted
                together come "Sinker," we wanted to make sure there was some synergy
                between them and this idea just didn't play nicely with others.</p>

              <p>Two, it was messing in a space mechanically that we wanted to explore
                in a future block. If it panned out, we were willing to let the future
                block fend for itself, but with the other issue, it became clear that we
                were messing with the future for not enough gain. It took us a while,
                but eventually we backed away from our first take on Azorius's keyword.
                When I finally get to the future I'm talking about, if I remember, I'll
                fill you all in on what Azorius was up to.</p>

              <p>After that, we experimented with a bunch of different mechanics, but
                none really stuck. So when the set went into devign, a sub-team was put
                together to come up with Azorius guild mechanics. For those who are
                unaware of what I mean by a sub-team, let me quickly explain: Sometimes,
                when a set needs a little help on a specific problem, we put together a
                separate design team to tackle the problem. Usually a sub-team will
                just meet for a week or two to help attack the problem from a different
                vantage point.</p>

              <p>The Azorius sub-team was led by <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=mark%20globus">Mark
                  Globus</a> and included <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=dave%20humpherys">Dave
                  Humpherys</a>, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=billy%20moreno">Billy
                  Moreno</a>, and Ken Nagle. Ken was there to represent the needs of <i>Return to Ravnica</i>.
                Humpherys was there to give a developer perspective, while Mark and
                Billy were there to design lots of cards. (While Billy is a developer,
                he has a strong design sensibility.)</p>

              <p>When the sub-team started, it used as inspiration a request from the developers. The development team
                had looked over <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                and felt the set needed a tempo-based mechanic. The sub-team came up
                with two ideas, one a little too simple and one a little too complex.
                The complex idea never got solved (although I am optimistic it might get
                solved one day so I'm not going to talk about it).</p>

              <p>The simple idea was building a mechanic around the idea of "tap a
                creature." The team knew that Azorius wanted to gain advantage by
                stopping the opponent's creatures, but only temporarily. The trick,
                though, was how to turn "tap a creature" into a full-blown mechanic.
                Eventually, the team came across the idea that the creature would be
                affected much like being tapped but without the actual tapping. The
                affected creature just couldn't attack or block. The team called this
                ability "jail."</p>

              <div>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Arrester"><img
                      alt="Azorius Arrester" src="Designing%20for%20Azorius_files/Image_003.jpg"></a></p>
              </div>
              &nbsp;

              <p>As the sub-team played with it, a few issues came up. First,
                shouldn't jailing a creature also stop it from doing other things? The
                spell <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Arrest">Arrest</a>,
                which had a similar flavor, prevented activated abilities. The team
                decided to add that in as well. Second, the team had to figure out a
                duration. Playtesting showed that "until your next turn" was short
                enough to be remembered but long enough to have an impact on both your
                turn and your opponent's, making both not blocking and not attacking
                matter.</p>

              <p>Third, there was the question of what could be detained. After some
                experimentation, the team came up with the idea that monocolored cards
                with detain worked on creatures while the multicolor ones would affect
                permanents. This idea stuck around all the way to print.</p>

              <table>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>
                      <div>
                        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulsworn+Spirit"><img
                              alt="Soulsworn Spirit" src="Designing%20for%20Azorius_files/Image_004.jpg"></a></p>
                      </div>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <div>
                        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+the+Triumvirate"><img
                              alt="Archon of the Triumvirate" src="Designing%20for%20Azorius_files/Image.jpg"></a></p>
                      </div>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              &nbsp;

              <p>When the team was done, it offered up the mechanic to the design team
                as its official recommendation. There was some concern from outside the
                team that detain was too dry and not very sexy. I was one of its
                defenders because I believed it did what a guild mechanic should—(a) it
                flavorfully reinforced the feel of the guild and (b) it would be liked
                by the style of player who likes playing Azorius. Hit those two points
                and all is good as far as I'm concerned.</p>

              <p>And that is how detain ended up the Azorius mechanic.</p>

              <h3>Any Final Thoughts?</h3>

              <p>I feel that <i>Return to Ravnica</i> did a good job of meeting Ken's
                goal of "doing Azorius right." I like how it controls the game but in a
                means that helps the game progress rather than dragging it to a
                standstill. I'm also happy how well the guild has been received.
                White-blue has the potential to be a little dry, so it's nice to see the
                guild being so embraced by the fans.</p>

              <h3>Control and Order</h3>

              <p>Like green-white, white-blue is combining two colors with a lot of
                overlap. The challenge of its design isn't finding spells that feel
                right but rather finding ones that are fun but flavorful. Capture that
                and you have a guild players can rally around.</p>
