              <p><img>Welcome to Gruul Week. This is the eighth column in a
                ten-column series talking about designing two-color pairs. Previously, I
                have talked about green-white (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/215">Selesnya</a>),
                white-blue (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/219">Azorius</a>),
                blue-red (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/221">Izzet</a>),
                black-green (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/223">Golgari</a>),
                black-red (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/225">Rakdos</a>),
                red-white (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/233">Boros</a>),
                and green-blue (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/235">Simic</a>).
                Also, during the original <i>Ravnica</i> block, I did <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/features.aspx?tag=color%20pie">a
                  ten-part series about the color philosophies</a> of each of the guild pairings. </p>
              <p>
                Here's how the columns from this series work. Each time, I answer the
                same four questions and then I explore the creation of both the <i>Ravnica</i> block mechanic for the
                guild and then the <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                block mechanic for the guild. For those of you who are reading this
                explanation for the eighth time, I'm sure you've got it memorized. </p>

              <ul>What's the Easiest Thing About This Color Pairing?</ul>
              <p>Red
                and green have a common pursuit. Unlike their shared enemy, blue, who
                likes to sit back and examine every option before taking action, red and
                green focus on getting things done. They want to attack. They want to
                play their creatures and hurl their spells and get in the opponent's
                face. This shared emphasis makes it easy to push red and green in the
                same direction.</p>
              <p> Red and green share the trample ability, they
                boost power, they destroy lands, they both have some access to mana
                ramping (green's are more permanent while red's are one-shot effects),
                both can have access to haste (although green only occasionally), they
                both have access to the fight ability, and they have the highest average
                of power on their common creatures. While red doesn't overlap with
                green as much as it overlaps with black, their unique abilities tend to
                work well together. For example, both red's direct damage and green's <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Giant+Growth">Giant
                  Growth</a>s help make sure they destroy any creatures that get in their way. Red's direct damage,
                along with its <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panic" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Panic">Panic</a>
                effects, also are good for removing blockers, allowing green's giant beasts to break through and hit
                the opponent. </p>
              <p>The
                thing that separates red-green from red-white or black-red is that
                red-green tends to rely a lot more on larger creatures, which it is able
                to quickly ramp into. Red-green isn't the fastest of the aggressive
                guilds but it has the largest punch. Once its stable of creatures gets
                rolling, there's not much that can stop it.</p>
              <ul>What's the Hardest Thing About This Color Pairing?</ul>
              <p>Red
                and green's single-mindedness makes it difficult to create a wide swath
                of different abilities. Sure, red-green can help win fights and do more
                damage, but after you do the few obvious things, the mechanical space
                dries up much quicker than many other color pairs.</p>
              <p>The trick to
                making red-green work is finding a lot of nuance in the area where they
                want to work together. There are numerous ways to help red-green
                strategy, but when designing them, you have to take extra care to keep
                them separated from one another.</p>
              <p>Another problem is that their
                flavor pushes heavily toward bluntness. Gruul is the guild that thinks
                things through the least, so the top-down flavor pushes you to make more
                blunt cards. Trying to capture this feel while also giving the player
                interesting strategic choices can often be a challenge. I feel that
                bloodrush managed to strike a balance here, but it's not an easy task
                for design to deal with.</p>

                  Briclot</a></p>
              <ul>What's the Mechanical Heart of This Color Pair?</ul>
              <p>Red-green's
                mechanical heart lies in its creatures. More specifically than that,
                red-green's mechanical heart lies in its attacking creatures. Red-green
                is driven not just to win with its creatures but to do so aggressively.
                Other color pairs might sit back, but not red-green. Red-green's focus
                is on its relentless pursuit of its goals through combat.</p>
              <p>What
                this means when you're designing for red-green is that you have to
                always be thinking both about its creatures and how it's going to
                attack. Notice that both Gruul mechanics not only make a creature bigger
                but encourage attacking as well.</p>
              <ul>What's the Focus of This Color Pair?</ul>
              <p>The
                mechanical heart is centered on attacking creatures. The color pair's
                focus, on the other hand, is more about how to build up the forces such
                that it can win through aggression. You see, here's the problem:
                Red-green is not a fast color pair. This stems from the fact that
                green's creatures are more about quality than quantity. (White is the
                creature color of quantity.)</p>
              <p>Green is good at both summoning giant
                creatures and having the mana ramp resources to be able to cast them.
                Red, with its direct damage, is actually a color capable of stalling.
                Add in that red has a little mana ramping of its own and its share of
                high-power creatures and the two colors have a common goal. Red-green
                isn't going to win by getting there first but by getting there with an
                attacking force that's difficult to stop.</p>
              <p>What this all means is
                that when designing red-green, you have to think about how the color
                pair is going to both grow and survive the early game to get to the
                point where it becomes its most potent. At this point, this blunt color
                pair requires a little more sophistication in design.</p>
              <p>As a
                designer, I find Gruul extra tricky because what it wants to accomplish
                and the feel the color pair needs to have are not completely in tandem.
                As you'll see in a moment, designing the mechanics for Gruul requires a
                subtle hand—something that, interestingly, Gruul is not.</p>
              <ul>Bloodthirst</ul>
              <p><img src="Designing%20for%20Gruul_files/mm237_bloodthirst.jpg"></p>
              <p>
                To start out our story of bloodthirst's creation we have to jump into
                our Wayback Machine and travel back to 2004, to the design of <i>Guildpact</i>. The design team was led
                by <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mike%20Elliott">Mike Elliott</a>
                (for those unfamiliar with the name, Mike has led the design of more <b>Magic</b> sets than anyone
                other than yours truly) and included <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Aaron%20Forsythe">Aaron
                  Forsythe</a> (current director of <b>Magic</b> and ex-head developer), <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Devin%20Low">Devin
                  Low</a> (also ex-head developer), and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Brian%20Schneider">Brian
                  Schneider</a> (a third ex-head developer, although at the time of this design team he was the
                then-current head developer). </p>
              <p>The
                team had the challenging task of finding the guild mechanic for Gruul. I
                say challenging because, as I talked about up above, trying to make a
                mechanic that has the simplistic single-mindedness of Gruul while also
                actually allowing interesting strategic game play is a tall order.</p>
              <p>
                The team started by examining the other guilds it had to build: Izzet
                and Orzhov. Izzet clearly wanted to focus on instants and sorceries.
                Orzhov wanted a slower style of play that plinked away at the
                opponent—what Ramp;D calls a bleeder deck. This meant that Gruul clearly
                wanted to be the aggressive guild of the set. (In contrast, as I'll
                talk about below, Gruul in <i>Gatecrash</i> isn't the most aggressive guild.) </p>
              <p>
                The team quickly decided that it wanted Gruul to be about attacking
                with creatures, which meant that its mechanic had to reward that
                behavior. After a little playtesting, it came to the conclusion that the
                mechanic needed to go a step farther. Not only should it reward
                attacking, it wanted to actively encourage it. The earliest version of
                the mechanic, which the team called paincast (and yes, paincast was also
                the name for the initial Rakdos mechanic in <i>Return to Ravnica</i>—note that it was a completely
                different mechanic) worked a lot like morbid from <i>Innistrad</i>. It merely asked if an opponent had
                been damaged this turn. If so, it enhanced the spell with the mechanic. </p>
              <p>I don't have the notes from the early design so here's a card I've made up to give an idea how it
                worked.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p> More Pain, My Gain<br> G<br> Instant<br> Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.<br>
                  Paincast—If an opponent has already been damaged this turn, that creature gets +4/+4 instead. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The problem with putting the ability on spells, though, was twofold:</p>
              <div>
                <ol>
                  <li>The
                    mechanic wants a deck full of creatures because it needs the opponent
                    to have taken damage. If the mechanic is sitting mostly on instants and
                    sorceries, it creates conflict because some number of cards in the deck
                    can't be creatures.</li>
                  <li>The Izzet mechanic wanted to focus on
                    spells, so its mechanic, replicate (the Izzet mechanic was the first one
                    the design team found), sat solely on instants and sorceries.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <p>
                These two points pushed hard for the paincast ability to appear solely
                on creatures. The team felt that this could be seen as a feature because
                it would create a nice contrast between the Gruul and the Izzet (the
                only two guilds in <i>Guildpact</i> to share a color). The question was what abilities to grant the
                creatures? </p>
              <p>
                The team messed around with various versions but, in the end, decided
                it would be best to have one unified effect. This would both help make
                the Gruul feel focused (remember that you want to give the Gruul the
                feeling of single-mindedness) and lower the complication. The most
                obvious choice was to turn the reward into +1/+1 counters. I believe the
                team talked about cost reduction (interestingly, what the initial <i>Return to Ravnica</i>
                Rakdos paincast mechanic was doing) but it seemed both a bit scary
                developmentally and a little too complex of a feeling for the Gruul. </p>
              <p>After
                some more playtesting, the design team realized that each bloodthirst
                creature essentially had two states: one slightly under the curve and
                one slightly above it. There was some talk of whether or not the damage
                wanted to be any damage or just combat damage, but the team felt it
                would be wrong to not let the color with direct damage interact with the
                mechanic.</p>
              <p>The design team also figured out that it was
                interesting to put bloodthirst on some creatures with rules text that
                cared about their power. This interacted not only with the +1/+1 counter
                but also with the power-pumping spells that existed in both red and
                green.</p>
              <p>Finally, the existence of bloodthirst encouraged the design
                team to impact the mix of the set around the mechanic. Certain cards
                that are traditionally weaker in Limited, such as one-drop creatures,
                became stronger when working in combination with bloodthirst.</p>

              <ul>Bloodrush</ul>
              <p> The <i>Gatecrash</i> design team (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=ethan%20fleischer">Ethan
                  Fleischer</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mark%20Gottlieb">Mark
                  Gottlieb</a>, Joe Huber, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=Dave%20Humpherys">Dave
                  Humpherys</a>, and myself) started in a similar place as the <i>Guildpact</i>
                design team. We knew red-green was centered on its creatures and that
                its route to victory was having bigger creatures than the opponent.
                Remember that <i>Gatecrash</i> also has the Boros guild, which was
                taking up the "weenie rush" slot. This led us to ask ourselves—how can
                we reward red-green for having the bigger creatures? </p>
              <p> The first obvious answer was fight. For those unaware, fight is a keyword action added to the game
                during <i>Innistrad</i> (although the first card to have its function was a promotional card called <a
                  href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Arena">Arena</a>
                that came out with one of <b>Magic</b>'s
                early books in 1994) that allows two creatures to get into a
                pseudo-combat where each deals its power in damage to the other. </p>
              <p>Fight
                was attractive for several reasons. First, it was flavorful for Gruul.
                Second, it was primary in green and secondary in red, matching up
                perfectly to Gruul colors. Third, it made size matter in an elegant way.
                The next step was figuring out how to use fight to help create a new
                keyword.</p>
              <p>After some thought, the team designed the first Gruul mechanic, called rowdy. Here's how rowdy was
                done:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p> Rowdy Bear<br> 2G<br> Creature—Bear<br> Rowdy—When CARDNAME deals combat damage to another player,
                  CARDNAME may fight with a creature controlled by that player. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The
                mechanic worked well. A little too well, actually. It was efficient at
                killing the opponent's creatures. Once the Gruul player got ahead, rowdy
                made it almost impossible for the opponent to come back. Dave
                Humpherys, who was the development representative on the team (and,
                interestingly, also the lead designer for the set), expressed concern.
                The mechanic was a little too overpowering, it created unfun game
                states, and it often made it impossible for the opponent to play
                creatures.</p>
              <p>Trying to keep the keyword revolving around fight, we
                took another stab at a mechanic that used it. This mechanic was called
                kickboxing:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p> Kickboxing Bear<br> 1G<br> Creature—Bear<br> Kickboxing—1G<br> When CARDNAME enters the
                  battlefield, you may pay the kickbox cost to have this creature fight target creature. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Kickboxing
                was quite simply a cross between fight and kicker. (Thus, the cutesy
                keyword name.) If you paid the kickbox cost, the creature would fight as
                an "enters the battlefield" effect. Kickboxing wasn't as devastating as
                rowdy but it still turned every creature with the ability into a
                potential two-for-one. Part of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/172">New
                  World Order</a>
                is that we've made two-for-ones default to uncommon or higher. We want
                our guild mechanic on common cards so, once again, it didn't work out.</p>
              <p>We
                tried a bunch of other mechanics that all encouraged attacking. Some of
                them showed promise but none quite had the Gruul feeling we were
                looking for. By this point, we were into a part of the process we call
                devign. Devign is the part between design and development where design
                still controls the file but development starts raising issues. This
                gives design time to address concerns that would potentially cause
                problems in development. By catching them early, design is able to think
                how it would rework the set to fix the problems development identifies.
                (Sometimes, by the way, design's job isn't to fix the problem but to
                explain to development why a certain thing needs to be done a particular
                way.) The design team brainstormed a bunch of different ideas for Gruul
                and passed a number of them by development. One that caught
                development's eye was bloodrush, at the time called ambush.</p>

              <p> The basic idea of a creature you could throw away to be a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth"
                  data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Giant+Growth">Giant
                  Growth</a> was solid, but it needed some tweaking to make it feel right. Here are a number of
                decisions that got made: </p>
              <div>
                <ol>
                  <li>The
                    power/toughness of the creature had to always match the power/toughness
                    bonus. This was key because otherwise the two abilities wouldn't feel
                    linked.</li>
                  <li>If the creature had a keyword ability, that ability also
                    had to be granted to the creature that was targeted by the "spell"
                    effect. A creature with trample, for example, would grant trample.</li>
                  <li>For various reasons, we didn't want any two bloodrush creatures having the same power/toughness
                    combination.</li>
                  <li> In general, we wanted the "spell" effect to be cheaper to cast than the creature. We did make
                    two exceptions (<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Viper"
                      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Wasteland+Viper">Wasteland
                      Viper</a> and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrecking+Ogre"
                      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Wrecking+Ogre">Wrecking
                      Ogre</a>), but both of these require the same amount of mana (although the <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrecking+Ogre"
                      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Wrecking+Ogre">Wrecking
                      Ogre</a> requires more red mana). </li>
                  <li>
                    For New World Order reasons, we chose to make all the commons vanilla
                    creatures (meaning no rules text other than the bloodrush). The
                    uncommons are all French vanilla creatures (only creature keyword
                    abilities other than the bloodrush). The rares are also French vanilla
                    creatures with only one exception (<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rubblehulk"
                      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Rubblehulk">Rubblehulk</a>).
                    The reason we mostly kept to vanilla and French vanillas? Bloodrush
                    takes three lines of rules text and we didn't want the cards too texty. </li>
                  <li>
                    The red "spells" tended to lean more toward power greater than
                    toughness while the green "spells" were more all over the board. This
                    reflects how each color uses <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth"
                      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Giant+Growth">Giant
                      Growth</a> effects. </li>
                  <li>We
                    tried to keep the "spell" costs on the low end because we wanted to
                    make sure they could be used without majorly telegraphing that the
                    "spell" was coming.</li>
                  <li> Finally, we had to be careful that the
                    granted keyword meant something along with being a power/toughness boost
                    and being cast as an instant during combat. For example, green has
                    access to vigilance, but that didn't work well with a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth"
                      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Giant+Growth">Giant
                      Growth</a>. The time you would have to use vigilance-granting would prevent you from surprising
                    your opponent with it. </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <p>Finding
                the right power/toughness and keyword mix took a lot of time (and
                continued through development). The cards might seem simple on the
                surface but getting the feel and game play right was the result of
                countless playtest iterations.</p>
