  <h1>Nuts &amp; Bolts: Troubleshooting</h1>

  <p>Okay,
    you've made your design skeleton, filled it in, started playtesting, and
    begun the iterative process. Now, I'm going to talk about some of the
    problems you're going to encounter along the way. Yes, it's
    troubleshooting time.</p>

<h2>"Houston, I think we have a problem."</h2>

  <p>Let me start by stressing that there are many problems that you can
    have when designing a set, way more than I could possibly ever cover in a
    single column. I've decided to focus on the most common problems to
    help the largest number of at-home designers. These are obviously the
    problems we've most often faced when making <em>Magic</em> sets, so today's article should give you some
    insight into some of the troubles we have.</p>

<h2>Problem #1: Not Enough Card Slots</h2>

  <p>You have a lot of cool ideas. You have neat themes. You have
    interesting mechanics. If only there was room to fit it all into your
    set. One of the important things about using a design skeleton is trying
    to figure out all the components your set wants and then making sure
    there's room for them all. There will come a time in most designs when
    you just have more cards than will fit. For us, this pinch happens most
    often at uncommon.</p>

  <p>The reason for this is simple. New World Order
    pushes certain things out of common for complexity reasons. Desire to
    make things Limited-relevant will push things down from rare. This
    results in uncommon just having a lot of responsibilities to cover. But
    this problem can and does happen at all rarities. You iterate and
    realize that you have new things you want in the file, but everything
    that's already there is there for a good reason and you don't want to
    take it out.</p>

  <p>There's a couple solutions to this problem:</p>

  <h3>1. Override your reluctance, take something out</h3>

  <p>There's a saying one of my writing teachers used to tell us: "Writing
    is about adding things to the page. Rewriting is about removing things
    from the page." During the initial portion of any creative activity, you
    are generating ideas. At some point, though, you have to take a step
    back and look critically at what you've made. During that introspective
    portion, you have to judge what is doing the work and what is just
    filling space.</p>

  <p>To quote a different teacher, this time a screenwriting professor:
    "No scene is worth a movie; no line is worth a scene." What she was
    saying was that no matter how good a scene you've written is, if it
    doesn't serve the movie it has to be cut. Likewise, no matter how good a
    line is, if it doesn't serve the scene it has to be cut. In other
    words, the whole is worth more than the individual parts. If a card is a
    brilliant, wonderful card but doesn't serve the set it's in, it has to
    go. (A good card will eventually find a home because, as I like to say, <em>Magic </em>is a hungry
    monster.)</p>

  <p>The same can be true of a mechanic or a theme. When your set gets
    overstuffed, you have to always begin by questioning everything you've
    chosen to keep in your set. Nothing passes the test once and never gets
    questioned again. As you iterate, the needs of your set are going to
    change, meaning you have to constantly re-question past assumptions.</p>

  <p>One of the harshest realities of this principle happens at the
    handoff between design and development. You're handing the file to a
    fresh set of eyes that doesn't have the biases you have. It's
    interesting how quickly whole sections can be challenged. Things that
    seemed immutable to you can get cut without a second thought.</p>

  <p>When deciding what to take out, here are the questions I'd ask:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is there any duplication? Are multiple elements of your set fulfilling the same role?</li>
    <li>Are there contrasting elements? Are two or more pieces of your set
      fighting with each other, creating unnecessary tension in gameplay?</li>
    <li>Is something going to be a problem down the road? Are there
      potential rules problems? Are there potential templating problems? Can
      the card(s)/mechanic actually be made?</li>
    <li>Is it fun enough? When you play, is this component holding its weight?</li>
    <li>Does this card shine in a vacuum but not fit in well with the rest of the set?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ask yourself all these questions honestly and then figure out if you can take out pieces to improve the
    overall design.</p>

  <h3>2. Combine two different components</h3>

  <p>Let's suppose you've done the above exercise and you're sure that you
    have the right amount of elements, and you're just off by a card or
    two. What do you do then? The best solution is overlapping the
    components on a single card.</p>

  <p>Let's take a practical example. You've looked over your file and you
    realize that with all the card juggling, you've ended up with two things
    missing in blue at common. You need a bounce spell (aka a spell that
    returns a permanent, most often a creature, to its owner's hand) because
    you currently don't have one and common should have at least one bounce
    effect. You also need another flier. Blue common usually wants a few
    fliers and you've decided you're one short. The problem is you only have
    one slot open. What do you do?</p>

  <p>The answer is to make a creature that flies and also doubles as a
    means to bounce something. As we're talking common, that would most
    likely mean an effect that would happen once. You have two obvious
    choices. You could put an "enters-the-battlefield" effect on the
    creature, or you could have it sacrifice, probably with a mana cost, to
    bounce something&mdash;most likely just a creature. The idea is to create one
    card that fulfills two roles. Now, you have to be careful. If you
    combine them poorly, the card will feel very forced; but done correctly,
    you can often make a card that's pretty unique.</p>

  <p>But what if you have two effects that just don't seem to fit
    together? Easy. Find an existing card with a mechanic that could combine
    with one of your two elements, combine them and then use the now empty
    slot you created to put the effect you couldn't combine. Remember when
    shifting effects around that you still need to keep to your
    creature/noncreature card counts, which occasionally might mean taking a
    noncreature effect and turning it into a creature or vice versa.</p>

<h2>Problem #2: Playtesters Are Not Playing Your Cards as You Intended</h2>

  <p>During the article on playtesting, I talked about the importance of
    getting playtesters who are unfamiliar with your set so that you can get
    fresh eyes on it. You are far too close to your set to understand what
    might confuse players, so it's crucial that you get playtesters to serve
    that role. So, what happens when you bring in playtesters and they just
    don't play things correctly?</p>

  <p>There are a couple solutions here:</p>

  <h3>1. Talk to the playtesters</h3>

  <p>While I don't like you talking to playtesters while they're figuring
    things out (you have a tendency to help them, which muddies the data
    collected), I am all in favor of you talking to them at the completion
    of the playtest. In fact, if you are not talking directly to your
    playtesters, you are missing out on a big reason why playtesting is
    happening in the first place. There is very important information to
    glean. Make sure you gather as much as you can.</p>

  <p>The reason I bring this up first is that there are many reasons why
    players might get things wrong. To understand why it's happening in your
    particular case, ask them directly. It's important to understand that
    they might not always know why, but they will at least give you some
    clues if not just outright giving the reason.</p>

  <h3>2. Do a templating/rules pass</h3>

  <p>The number-one reason players get confused is a communications issue.
    The words you've chosen to convey something either don't convey what
    you mean or are ambiguous enough that it allows other interpretations.
    This is very hard for you to see in a vacuum because you know what you
    mean. The best advice I have here is to find another person who has some
    knowledge of templating to do a pass. Obviously, at Wizards we have
    professional editors for this task. It's common for us to run cards by
    them during design if we feel that we're not doing a good enough job
    conveying what we mean.</p>

  <p><em>Magic </em>templating can get very complex, so my advice for
    anyone trying to do templating is simple: Whenever you're templating,
    find a card in <em>Magic</em> that did something similar. Don't start from scratch. Build off of existing
    <em>Magic</em>
    templating. My one caveat is that the more recent the printing of the
    card, the better, because we do change templating over time. Also, it's
    okay to make multiple templates and then try out different ones to see
    which ones are easier for players to grasp.</p>

  <p>The companion problem to templating issues is rules issues. Sometimes
    players understand what the words say but have problems when they
    contradict elements of the rules. Interestingly, the more common problem
    is not that players feel the rules don't allow something, but rather
    that they do things the rules don't allow because they believe the card
    overrides those rules. Just as I advise getting another set of eyes on
    templating, having someone else look over your cards for rules issues is
    valuable. A good resource for this is judges, who have to have a
    certain level of rules knowledge to be certified as a judge.</p>

  <h3>3. Understand player intuition and match it when you can</h3>

  <p>The number-one cause of confusion is templating/rules issues. The
    number-two cause is that the card is contradicting the player's
    intuition. I talk about this all the time, but I can't stress it enough.
    Human intuition is very powerful. Fighting against this force is
    usually a hopeless task. The goal is not to make your player change how
    they normally function but to have your game component match their
    expectation. I say it often and I will repeat it again: fighting human
    nature is a losing battle.</p>

  <p>Let me give a practical example. During <em>Time Spiral</em>&nbsp;design,
    we created the suspend mechanic. For those who have never played it,
    the mechanic allowed you to trade mana for time. Spells that would
    normally cost more cost much less, but you had to wait some number of
    turns before they happened. The problem we were running into was this. A
    lot of the cards with suspend were creatures. You would cast them, put
    them in exile, and remove a counter every turn, and then when there were
    no more counters you would put them onto the battlefield. Now,
    according to the rules, the creatures had summoning sickness. They
    weren't allowed to attack because they hadn't started the turn on the
    battlefield. Here's the problem&mdash;the vast majority of players would
    attack with their creature the turn it entered the battlefield.</p>

  <p>We tried wording the reminder text differently. We added more text to
    stress they couldn't attack. We contemplated having them all enter the
    battlefield tapped. But then, one day, I said, let's figure out why this
    is happening. As I talked with playtesters, I realized two things.
    First, they felt like they cast the creature the turn they paid the mana
    for it, not the turn it finally entered the battlefield. Technically, a
    suspend spell isn't cast until all its counters are removed, but that
    wasn't how it felt to players.</p>

  <p>Second, there was a lot of waiting with suspend. Each turn, you had
    to remove a counter, and there was this desire to finally get it onto
    the battlefield. Players felt like when they took off the last counter,
    they finally got the creature. As such, they wanted to use it right
    away. Putting it onto the battlefield but not being able to attack with
    it felt like they were forced to wait yet another turn before they got
    to play with it.</p>

  <p>So what was the solution? We added haste to all the suspend
    creatures. Players wanted to attack with their creature the turn they
    entered the battlefield, so we let them. We made that action the correct
    play.</p>

  <p>When you're playtesting your cards, keep an eye on whether or not
    confusion is caused by the fact that the cards aren't doing what players
    assume they do. It doesn't matter how clearly and specifically it's
    spelled out in the rules text. If it contradicts what players think is
    correct, most of them will skim over the actual text and follow their
    intuition.</p>

<h2>Problem #3: The Games Keep Bogging Down into a Stall</h2>

  <p>Another problem that often shows up in playtesting is when the games
    won't end. Players play cards, but nothing ever seems to advance the
    game, ending up with a very cluttered battlefield and no end in sight.
    When this happens, the following are the most likely solutions:</p>

  <h3>1. Check your levels of evasion</h3>

  <p>I've talked before about how your game needs inertia. It needs some
    part of it pushing toward a completion. With creatures, this means you
    need to make sure that some of them have the ability to make it through a
    stall. This is what R&amp;D refers to as "evasion." Evasion comes in
    several levels:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1: Mostly can't be blocked&mdash;</strong>Creatures of
      this level usually set a "clock" for the opponent, meaning they dictate
      how many turns until the game ends if the opponent can't find an answer
      for the creature. The two most common abilities that fall into level 1
      are "can't be blocked" and flying. You want to have at least five
      percent of your creatures in level 1.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2: Conditionally can't be blocked&mdash;</strong>These are
      abilities that under the right conditions make it so the opponent is
      either at a disadvantage if they block the creature or simply are unable
      to block it. Keywords that fall in this category include deathtouch,
      double strike, first strike, indestructible, menace, prowess, and
      trample. You want to have creatures of this level also be at least five
      percent of your creatures.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3: Blocked at a loss&mdash;</strong>This last level applies
      mostly to larger creatures that can't be ignored because they do a
      significant amount of damage but usually require more than one creature
      to trade. A good example of this would be a 6/6 vanilla creature. If
      your opponent can't answer it with a spell, they are forced to either
      trade multiple creatures or continually "chump block" it (meaning
      blocking with a small creature that will die and simply prevents the
      damage for a turn). This last level should also be roughly five percent
      (although this category can dip a little below the other two).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>One final note for this category is that there are cards that, instead of being in one of these levels,
    have the ability to <em>grant</em> that level, sometimes temporarily and sometimes permanently. For
    instance, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Warriors" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Dwarven+Warriors">Dwarven
      Warriors</a>
    is a card that makes creatures with 2 power or less unblockable. That
    would be thought of as a level 1 card even though it itself will never
    attack.</p>

  <h3>2. Check your toughness</h3>

  <p>Another common problem is you've made your creatures too defensive.
    The single biggest error made in this category is putting too much
    toughness on your creatures. If toughness averages higher than power,
    then you create an environment where, on average, creatures have trouble
    getting through. (Obviously, the type and amount of evasion has an
    impact.) If you are finding board stalls, one simple answer is to remove
    some toughness and see if that helps push the game more toward
    aggression.</p>

  <h3>3. Check your levels of creature destruction</h3>

  <p>This category is one of the trickiest because you can err in either
    direction. Don't add enough creature removal and the battlefield starts
    getting too crowded because there aren't answers. Have too much creature
    removal and no one can keep a creature on the battlefield, especially
    evasive creatures. In general, if you're seeing stalls where players
    have too many creatures, your creature destruction is probably a little
    low. If no one can keep a creature on the battlefield, it's probably too
    high.</p>

  <p>Remember that you have the ability to customize your creature
    destruction, meaning that you can direct what types of creatures are
    easier and harder to kill. For example, if your direct damage at common
    does 3 damage or less, then a 4-toughness creature becomes harder to
    kill.</p>

  <h3>4. Check your "reset buttons" and "bombs"</h3>

  <p>This solution is focused mostly on higher-rarity cards. There are two
    ways to help players deal with stalled boards. First is what we in
    R&amp;D call a "reset button." These are cards that change the board
    state radically, often removing most of the creatures. Some "reset
    buttons" work independently, while others force the player to generate a
    certain board state (the most common of which is to radically alter a
    busy combat situation to your favor). Second is what are referred to as
    "bombs." These are cards that single-handedly have the capacity to win
    the game and force the opponent to find an answer within a few turns or
    lose. Try to make sure that all colors have some access to reset buttons
    and/or bombs. Note that all-common playtests will show a lot of signs
    of deficiency in this area because neither type of card shows up at
    common. The goal for these cards is to make sure you have enough that
    each deck has access to a few.</p>

  <p>The key to solving the board stalls is figuring out either why you
    don't have enough cards that can break through or why they all keep
    getting destroyed. It's a delicate balance and will require a lot of
    fine tuning, but the above areas are the most likely culprits.</p>
