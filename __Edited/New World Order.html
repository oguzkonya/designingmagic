  <h1>New World Order</h1>

  <p>This column will introduce you to a big problem we had to solve,
    the solution that problem led to, and the realization that our solution
    not only solved our problem but made the game better overall. There's a
    lot to cover, so let's get started.</p>

    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
  <p>As our story is all about solving a problem, I believe the best place
    to begin is with the problem itself. To do this, we need to go back
    about six years. I often talk about how we track a lot of numbers. Part
    of running a business is understanding how things are going, and six
    years ago we had a big problem. One of our most important numbers, the
    number of people who play <i>Magic</i> , was going down. We did a lot of
    research and discovered the cause: our acquisition was on the decline.
    In other words, fewer people were learning to play <i>Magic</i> . The big question was: Why? What about
    <i>Magic</i> was keeping new players from wanting to play the game?</p>

  <p>We studied the problem and found a culprit that I often talk about: complexity creep. Let me show you
    what I'm talking about.</p>

  <p><img src="New%20World%20Order_files/mm172_graph.jpg"></p>

  <p>The green line marks the complexity of the game over time. (Note that
    this chart is for explanation purposes and does not reflect any actual
    data.) <i>Magic</i> is a trading card game, which means each year we
    introduce new cards and new mechanics and new concepts and new themes.
    As we do that, complexity slowly creeps upward as the game keeps adding
    components.</p>

  <p>The red line is the baseline. That represents where a new player
    approaches the game. The baseline never changes, because a new player is
    always in the same place, they know nothing. The space between the red
    line and the green line is what we in R&amp;D call "the barrier to
    entry." The taller that gap, the harder it is to make the leap from
    nonplayer to player. This graph does a good job of showing our problem.
    Complexity creep was increasing our barrier to entry, making it harder
    and harder for new players to learn how to play. We were failing to get
    as many new players because the game was getting progressively harder to
    learn.</p>

  <p>R&amp;D understood that this was a giant threat to the game,
    something that if left unchecked would create an impact for all the
    players. It was a problem that had to be solved.</p>

<h2>A Complex Problem</h2>

  <p>This whole discovery happened during <i>Time Spiral</i> block. We
    looked around and realized that we were in the middle of making the most
    complex block we had ever made. There were almost as many named keyword
    mechanics in <i>Future Sight</i>, for example, as had existed in all of <i>Magic</i> up to <i>Future
      Sight</i>'s release. <i>Time Spiral</i> block, though, was too far along to change, so we focused on
    the next block, <i>Lorwyn</i>.</p>

  <p>Our goal with <i>Lorwyn</i> was to make the cards more
    straightforward. We wanted the rules text to be very clear in what the
    cards did. We spent a lot of time making sure their intent was simple
    and understandable, but as the block played out we discovered that we
    hadn't gotten rid of the complexity; we had just moved it to a different
    area of the game. I'll explain.</p>

  <p>What we learned was that there are three types of complexity in a game:</p>

  <h3>Comprehension Complexity</h3>

  <p>This type of complexity has to do with the players understanding what
    a card does. Quite bluntly, can the players read the card and know how
    it works in the game? This might sound silly, but <i>Magic</i> has definitely veered hard into this
    category in its history. For instance, let's take the suspend mechanic from <i>Time Spiral</i> block.</p>

  <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant%20Ephemeron" target="_blank"><img src="New%20World%20Order_files/Image_002.jpg"></a></p>

  <p>It's a perfect example of a mechanic that seems easy if you get it
    but proved to be a major stumbling block for many players. Design
    pursued this mechanic because "paying time instead of mana" seemed like a
    cool and grokable idea, but the manipulation required along with the
    changing of zones and the lengthy and complicated text overwhelmed a lot
    of people.</p>

  <p>This was the type of complexity <i>Lorwyn</i> went after.</p>

  <p>Note that time has shown us a second facet of comprehension
    complexity, a subset I call intuitive comprehension. Here's an example:</p>

  <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scornful%20Egotist" target="_blank"><img src="New%20World%20Order_files/Image.jpg"></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scornful+Egotist" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Scornful+Egotist">Scornful
      Egotist</a>, from <i>Scourge</i>,
    isn't confusing in what it says. It's a 1/1 with morph for 7U. The
    problem is that many players didn't understand the eight-mana cost. For
    those unfamiliar with <i>Scourge</i>, it had a "converted mana cost matters" theme. <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scornful+Egotist"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Scornful+Egotist">Scornful
      Egotist</a>'s
    high converted mana cost was considered a bonus for the card (you got
    it into play using the morph). Unfortunately, this theme didn't draw as
    much attention to itself as it could and the card just ended up baffling
    many players because they couldn't comprehend why the card was doing
    what it did.</p>

  <p>Intuitive comprehension is all about players understanding and
    accepting what they read. When the words don't make sense because of
    context, it can be just as confusing as when they don't make sense
    inherently. I'm not saying we shouldn't make these kinds of cards just
    stressing that we have to accept that they are more complex than one
    would realize at first glance.</p>

  <h3>Board Complexity</h3>

  <p>Here was the problem that reared its head during <i>Lorwyn</i> and <i>Morningtide</i>.
    This type of complexity isn't about what cards can do but rather about
    how they interact with one another while they are on the battlefield.
    This problem was most noticeable to R&amp;D during the employee
    Prerelease for <i>Morningtide</i>. The casual players were quitting
    after one or two rounds and we kept watching people who stayed in suffer
    as they couldn't figure out what they had to do. There was just too
    much dependent interaction.</p>

  <p>Another important lesson about board complexity was that it didn't
    take very many cards with this style of complexity to cause problems.
    Just one card, for example, can change the design tree from a few
    choices to a double-digit number of choices.</p>

  <p><i>Magic</i> is a game about interactions. This type of complexity
    stresses that too much interaction can be just as taxing mentally as
    cards that take multiple readings to comprehend.</p>

  <h3>Strategic Complexity</h3>

  <p>This type of complexity is about understanding how best to use your cards. One of the reasons <i>Magic</i>
    has the depth of play it does is because there is a lot of subtlety to
    how cards can best be used. Are you supposed to play a card as soon as
    you can or hold it until a more optimal situation arises? When do you
    sacrifice a resource to gain long-term advantage? Is a certain card
    optimal in a particular draft strategy? Questions like these are all
    examples of strategic complexity.</p>

  <p>This complexity is all about maximizing a card's usefulness, about understanding <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fundamentals/3690_Tempo_And_Card_Advantage.html"
      target="_blank">tempo and card advantage</a>, about knowing <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fundamentals/3692_Whos_The_Beatdown.html"
      target="_blank">who's the beatdown</a>.
    This complexity is about understanding the intricacies of the game. It
    is what separates a pro player from an average Friday Night <i>Magic</i> player.</p>

<h2>Common Knowledge</h2>

  <p>Sometimes it helps to lay out a problem when you're trying to solve
    it. Here's what we knew: We had to bring down the level of barrier to
    entry. It had simply gotten too high. The game was filled with all sorts
    of complexity, which was pushing it up. On the flip side, though, we
    had the established players. Much of what was creating the complexity
    stemmed from things that were important to keep our existing players. <i>Magic</i>
    has to keep adding new elements. Expansions have to have new mechanics
    and new keywords and new themes and new strategies. How could we
    possibly make all the parties happy?</p>

  <p>The solution ended up being a tool that trading card games had always
    had: rarity. How could we get things into the hands of the experienced
    players without overwhelming the less experienced players? We simply had
    to keep it out of common. We knew that beginning players buy fewer
    boosters. This means that the percentage of relevant cards they own that
    are common is simply much higher.</p>

  <p>"Keep it out of common" is actually incorrect. The theory behind New
    World Order was this: we have to be very careful about what we put at
    common. We had to redraw the line for what level of complexity was
    acceptable. We were allowed some complexity at common, but less than we
    had used in the past, which meant it was a resource that had to be
    carefully managed.</p>

  <p>To offset the shift of complexity, New World Order allowed higher
    rarities, especially uncommon, to tick up in complexity. The goal wasn't
    to remove complexity, but to shift where it was positioned in the game.
    The idea was that by moving where it sat, we lessened it for the
    players who needed it lessened and kept it there for the experienced
    players who wanted it.</p>

  <p>Once we thought of complexity as a limited resource at common, it
    radically changed how we approached making commons. For instance, I
    often say "If your theme is not at common, it's not your theme." Because
    the theme by its nature tends to involve complexity (themes tend to
    require players caring about something you don't normally care about),
    it meant that we had to allocate a certain portion of our common
    complexity to supporting the theme.</p>

  <p>I will stress again that common is allowed some complexity. The big
    shift of New World Order is that R&amp;D is much more conscious about
    where and how it is used. If a common card is complex, it has to have a
    reason; it has to serve a purpose. And even then, there has to be a
    limit to how much complexity shows up at common. Each card has to be
    judged, and then all the common cards have to be judged together.</p>

  <p>Another big jump was the realization that not all complexity is the
    same. Comprehension complexity and board complexity are a problem for
    beginners. Strategic complexity is not. Why? Because beginners can't see
    strategic complexity. It requires a certain amount of game knowledge
    before it's visible. This meant it was exempt from most of the
    complexity crackdown at common. The trick, though, was finding ways to
    put strategic complexity at common without also having comprehension and
    board complexity.</p>

<h2>A Whole New World</h2>

  <p>New World Order required a radically different way of looking at <i>Magic</i>
    expansions, but once R&amp;D shifted our mindset, we found something
    even more exciting. When we started playing with the New World
    Order-shifted sets, we discovered that they were more fun. I'm not
    talking about for beginners; I'm talking about for R&amp;D, a very
    established group of longtime <i>Magic</i> players. Why? Simply put, New
    World Order brought clarity to the game. (I termed this phrase because I
    believe strongly that you need language to guide behavior. If you can't
    talk about something it's hard to think about it. The term helped
    cement the concept for R&amp;D.)</p>

  <p>To understand what was going on let's jump away from <i>Magic</i>
    design to design in general. Last year I wrote a two-part article
    talking about the Ten Principles of Design by a famous industrial
    designer named Dieter Rams (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/89"
      target="_blank">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/91"
      target="_blank">Part 2</a>). Principle Number 10 was "Good design is as little design as possible."</p>

  <p>The role of a designer is to only use what you absolutely have to. If
    a creation can exist without something, a good designer will take it
    away. For game design, this means that you want to only leave in the
    game what is necessary for the game to function. When we boiled down our
    commons to their bare essence, what we found was that we had made a
    cleaner game. Instead of focusing on lots of tiny elements that gave you
    little incremental advantages, you were able to focus on the key things
    that mattered.</p>

  <p>Another way to think about is this: Simplifying the commons took away
    a lot of bookkeeping. By bookkeeping, I mean the requirement to pay
    attention to elements of the game that <i>could</i> matter but often
    don't. In general, bookkeeping is something you want to take out of
    games. Keeping track of a lot of information is actually an unfun
    activity, but gamers do it because they are doing their best to win.</p>

  <p>I've talked about this before that players will do whatever the game
    incentivizes them to do whether or not that thing is fun. The goal of a
    game designer is to make the incentives move the players towards the
    parts of the game that<i> are</i> fun. Tracking lots of information is not what makes <i>Magic</i>
    fun, yet complexity applied to the wrong places can make that the
    focus. By stripping away the complexity at common, we were able to move
    the focus back to things like combat and spell casting.</p>

  <p>For those that are worried that this is boring, I ask you to simply
    try the following experiment. Make two decks of just vanilla creatures
    and common sorceries. (This is very similar to a beginner product we
    made long ago named <i>Portal</i>.) Find a player of a similar skill
    level to your own and play the decks against each other. What you will
    find is that these games are actually quite interesting. It's easy to
    get caught up in all the complexity of <i>Magic</i> that you forget how much fun the base of the game
    is—and not just fun, skillful.</p>

  <p>Be aware there still are a staggering amount of decisions in an average <i>Magic</i>
    game. New World Order didn't lessen the overall skill of the game. What
    it did was shift the focus on the ability to make the right decisions
    rather than keep track of excessive amounts of data. Chess, for example,
    doesn't get more skillful if you add in four new piece types and double
    the size of the board (nor, for that matter, does it get more fun).</p>

  <p><i>Magic</i> has had a huge amount of success in the last three
    years, and R&amp;D believes strongly that New World Order has had a lot
    to do with it. It helped us refocus what mattered in the game. I also
    believe New World Order had another great impact. I've explained that
    Aaron was very influenced by <i>Alpha</i> in his creation of <i><i>Magic</i> 2010</i>,
    the product that pushed us down our current path of resonance. I
    believe that New World Order, and the refocusing that came with it,
    helped bring about the mental shift that brought Aaron back to <i>Alpha</i> as an influence.</p>

  <p>New World Order has made all sorts of ripples through the game. As
    another example, I believe our current push toward making more cards
    Limited playable has come from our exploring ways to bring strategic
    complexity to common. Creating cards that are useful in one type of deck
    but poor in another makes commons that are strategically dynamic
    without being confusing for the newer player (high in strategic
    complexity, low in comprehension and board complexity).</p>

  <p>In many ways, the excitement of New World Order for R&amp;D has been
    the complete rethinking of how we use our resources, not just at common
    but throughout the game. Understanding what is complex and how has
    completely reshaped how we design and develop the game.</p>

<h2>All Together Now</h2>

  <p>The real lesson of today's story hits another common theme of this
    column: the holistic nature of design. R&amp;D set out to solve an
    acquisition problem and ended up with a way to refresh the essence of
    the game. Making the game better for one section of the audience led to
    making it better for all sections.</p>
