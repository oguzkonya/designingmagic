  <h1>Timmy, Johnny, and Spike</h1>
  <p>Here in <b>Magic </b>R&amp;D
    our job is create a game that makes players happy. In order to do this,
    we have to find out what players like about our game. Doing so has been
    a long ongoing process involving numerous factors. We’ve done
    questionnaires. We’ve done focus groups. We’ve lurked on <b>Magic </b>web sites and bulletin boards.
    We’ve talked to players in person. Heck, we even see what articles you read on this site.</p>

  <p>After numerous years, we’ve come to the conclusion that there are three basic types of <b>Magic </b>players.
    The fancy term for these categories is "psychographic profiles." A
    psychographic profile separates players into categories based on their
    psychological make-up. What motivates that player to play? What kind of
    cards do they like? What kind of things encourages that player to keep
    on playing?</p>

  <p>Because R&amp;D loves naming things, we have given each of these
    three category types a name: Timmy, Johnny, and Spike. In this column I
    am going to explain each type and talk about how we came up with the
    goofy nickname.</p>

  <p>One last thing before I start. Very few players fall into one
    specific psychographic profile. Most players have elements that overlap
    numerous profiles. This is why, for example, some of you who took the
    test got a combination of profiles rather than just one. I will talk
    about the hybrids after I explain each profile.</p>

  <h3>Timmy</h3>

  <p>Timmy wasn't the first profile we created, but it was the first profile we named. Timmy’s naming
    happened by accident during <i>Tempest </i>design. We were talking about whether or not <a>Verdant Force</a>
    would be popular. I happen to have a flair for the dramatic (if you
    haven’t caught on yet), so I started one of my little speeches:
    (Incidentally, I’m not 100% sure why I chose the name "Timmy." I wanted
    to personify the kid so I gave him a name and Timmy had this innocent
    little-kid quality to it that must have struck my fancy in the heat of
    the moment.)</p>

  <p>“Imagine a kid goes into a game store. Let’s just call him… 'Timmy.'
    Now, Timmy doesn’t have a lot of money. So, he buys one pack of
    Bogavhati (<i>Tempest</i>’s codename). He rips it open and starts
    tearing through the cards to find the rare. And then he sees it. It’s a
    big green creature. Seven power. Seven toughness. It’s huge. Huge! He’s
    eyes keep moving. He glances up at the casting cost: <span style="white-space: nowrap"><img alt="5 Mana" src="Timmy,%20Johnny,%20and%20Spike_files/mtg_5.png"
        width="12" height="12"><img alt="Green Mana" src="Timmy,%20Johnny,%20and%20Spike_files/mtg_green.png" width="12"
        height="12"><img alt="Green Mana" src="Timmy,%20Johnny,%20and%20Spike_files/mtg_green.png" width="12" height="12"><img
        alt="Green Mana" src="Timmy,%20Johnny,%20and%20Spike_files/mtg_green.png" width="12" height="12"></span>,
    blah, blah, blah. Boring. Move on. Timmy looks at the rules text.
    There’s a bunch of words. Timmy reads. Every turn Timmy gets another
    creature. Another entire creature. It’s small, but in ten turns, he’ll
    have twenty creatures. A 7/7 creature with twenty 1/1s. How does his
    opponent stop that? It can’t be stopped! Timmy finally exhales. He has
    found the Holy Grail.”</p>

  <p>For some reason, the name Timmy stuck.</p>

  <p>Timmy is what we in R&amp;D call the "power gamer." Timmy likes to
    win big. He doesn’t want to eke out a last minute victory. Timmy wants
    to smash his opponents. He likes his cards to be impressive, and he
    enjoys playing big creatures and big spells.</p>

  <p>One of the misconceptions is that Timmy has to be young. While its
    true that younger players are more apt to fall into this category,
    players of any age can be a Timmy. What sets Timmy apart from the other
    two profiles is that Timmy is motivated by fun. He plays <b>Magic </b>because it’s enjoyable. Timmy is
    very social. An important part of the game is sitting around with his friends.</p>

  <p>Timmy cares more about the quality of his win than the quantity of
    his wins. For example, Timmy sits down and plays ten games. He only wins
    three games out of ten but the three he wins, he dominates his
    opponent. Timmy had fun. Timmy walks away happy.</p>

  <p>Each set, R&amp;D makes sure to design a certain number of cards for
    Timmy. Timmy cards, as we call them, tend to be big creatures or spells
    with big effects. In general, Timmy cards are exciting but not too
    economical. The more efficiently costed ones will catch Spike’s eye.
    Good examples of Timmy cards are: <a>Krosan Beast</a>, <a>Iridescent Angel</a>, and just about any
    dragon.</p>

  <h3>Johnny</h3>

  <p>Johnny was the second profile to get a name. During <i>Urza’s Saga</i>
    development, R&amp;D had accepted the Timmy and "tournament player"
    profiles, but I believed that there was an important profile missing.
    You see, I wasn’t really a Timmy player and I wasn’t really a tournament
    player. I was this missing third type. While trying to explain who he
    was, I stumbled into calling him "Johnny." Like Timmy, the name stuck.</p>

  <p>Johnny is the creative gamer to whom <b>Magic </b>is a form of
    self-expression. Johnny likes to win, but he wants to win with style.
    It’s very important to Johnny that he win on his own terms. As such,
    it’s important to Johnny that he’s using his own deck. Playing <b>Magic</b> is an opportunity for Johnny
    to show off his creativity.</p>

  <p>Johnny likes a challenge. Johnny enjoys winning with cards that no
    one else wants to use. He likes making decks that win in innovative
    ways. What sets Johnny apart from the other profiles is that Johnny
    enjoys deckbuilding as much as (or more than) he enjoys playing. Johnny
    loves the cool interactions of the cards. He loves combo decks. Johnny
    is happiest when he’s exploring uncharted territory.</p>

  <p>Like Timmy, Johnny cares more about the quality of his wins than the
    quantity. For example, let's say Johnny builds a new deck that has a
    neat but difficult way to win. He plays ten games and manages to get his
    deck to do its thing… once. Johnny walks away happy.</p>

  <p>Each set, R&amp;D designs some cards for Johnny. Johnny cards are
    cards that have unique effects that Johnny can build cool decks around.
    In general, Johnny cards are the kind of cards with real potential.
    (Some of them will eventually excite Spike.) Good examples of Johnny
    cards are <a>Holistic Wisdom</a>, <a>Radiate</a>, and <a>Battle of Wits</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="Timmy,%20Johnny,%20and%20Spike_files/mtgcom_daily_mr11b_pic3_en.jpg"></p>

  <h3>Spike</h3>

  <p>Although Spike was the first profile R&amp;D was aware of, it was the
    last to get a name. In fact, "Spike" is the only nickname I didn’t come
    up with. None of R&amp;D did. You see for years, R&amp;D just called
    them Timmy, Johnny, and "the tournament player." But at some point we
    explained the three profiles to the <b>Magic </b>brand team. They felt
    the tournament player needed a name, so they named him. Why "Spike?" The
    best I’ve been able to figure out is they felt Spike sounded like a
    serious, play-to-win-type name.</p>

  <p>Spike is the competitive player. Spike plays to win. Spike enjoys
    winning. To accomplish this, Spike will play whatever the best deck is.
    Spike will copy decks off the Internet. Spike will borrow other players’
    decks. To Spike, the thrill of <b>Magic </b>is the adrenalin rush of competition. Spike enjoys the
    stimulation of outplaying the opponent and the glory of victory.</p>

  <p>Spike cares more about the quantity of wins than the quality. For
    example, Spike plays ten games and wins nine of them. If Spike feels he
    should have won the tenth, he walks away unhappy.</p>

  <p>R&amp;D makes plenty of cards for Spike. Unlike the Timmy and Johnny
    cards, Spike cards are relatively easy to make. Spike plays what wins,
    so if R&amp;D makes a card good enough, Spike will play it. Good
    examples of Spike cards are <a>Call of the Herd</a>, <a>Shadowmage Infiltrator</a>, and <a>Fact or
      Fiction</a>.</p>

  <h3>The Hybrids</h3>

  <p>Many players do not fit so easily in one box. These players have bits and pieces of multiple profiles.</p>

  <h3>Timmy/Johnny or Johnny/Timmy</h3>

  <p>The Timmy/Johnny player likes the cool big effects but also enjoys
    the creative side of the game. A perfect example of a Timmy/Johnny card
    is <a>Haunting Echoes</a>. The card has a huge effect that attracts
    Timmy but offers cool deck potentials for Johnny. The Timmy/Johnny wants
    to smash his opponent, but with style.</p>

  <h3>Timmy/Spike or Spike/Timmy</h3>

  <p>The Timmy/Spike player wants to win, but also like to indulge his fun
    side. When picking a deck, Timmy/Spike will always pick the good deck
    with the biggest creatures or effects. A good example of a Timmy/Spike
    card is <a>Rith, the Awakener</a>. Rith is a big dragon, but one that’s costed aggressively with a good
    special ability.</p>

  <h3>Johnny/Spike or Spike/Johnny</h3>

  <p>The Johnny/Spike player wants to win but only on his own terms. Most
    of the rogue tournament deckbuilders are Johnny/Spikes. They go to great
    lengths to be able to win with original decks. Even when they have to
    use a pre-made deck, they will always tweak it to give the deck their
    own spin. A good example of a Johnny/Spike card is <a>Basking Rootwalla</a>. The card is cool and offers
    interesting deckbuilding opportunities but still has the raw power needed to win.</p>

  <h3>Timmy/Johnny/Spike (All Three)</h3>

  <p>The Timmy/Johnny/Spike players want it all. They want to play big
    cards, have innovative decks, and yet still win as much as possible.
    This hybrid is a rare breed as few players are pulled in all three
    directions. As such, R&amp;D does not design too many cards that hit all
    three profiles at once. One example of a card that appealed to all
    three groups was <a>Verdant Force</a>. Timmy liked its huge size, Johnny appreciated its combo
    possibilities, and Spike liked its utility in reanimation and <a>Natural Order</a>-based decks.</p>

  <p>There you have it. These are the profiles R&amp;D considers when
    designing (and developing) cards. Be aware that these profiles apply to
    the motivations of the players and not the formats they play. Timmy can
    play in tournaments and Spike can play multi-player games. In a future
    article I will talk more about how R&amp;D designs cards specifically
    for competitive and casual play.</p>
