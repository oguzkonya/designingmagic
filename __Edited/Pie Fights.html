  <h1>Pie Fights</h1>

  <p>In this column, I'm going to look at the five basic conflicts of the color pie.
    I'll not only explain what the conflicts are but how they overlap with
    one another.</p>
    
  <p>If you've ever looked at the back of a <em>Magic</em> card, you've seen this circle, aka the color
    wheel.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_Wheel.png"></p>

  <p>Colors are allied with the two colors on either side of them, and are
    enemies with the colors across from them. Now that we've examined each
    of the colors separately, let's look at what happens when we match up
    colors with their enemy. As you will see, five conflicts arise.</p>

  <h3>The Good of the Group vs. The Good of the Individual (White vs. Black)</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_WB.png"></p>

  <p>White believes in morality, that there are absolute truths about the
    concepts of right and wrong. One of these truths is that a society needs
    to look out for its weakest members; it's not okay for one person to
    gorge themselves while another is starving. As such, it's key that the
    structure of society be made to maximize protecting those who most need
    the help.</p>

  <p>Black believes it's important to motivate people to want to do well.
    Give everyone access to opportunity and then allow those who put in the
    work to reap the rewards. If one person puts in the time and energy to
    create excellence, why should they be given the same thing as someone
    who didn't even bother to try? If you want people to shine, you need to
    properly motivate them.</p>

  <p>In short, this is the classic battle of the good of the group versus
    the good of the individual. Should a society minimize pain or maximize
    motivation? Which is more important&mdash;charity or merit? Is allowing people
    to fail a great injustice or an important teaching opportunity? Are we
    as a society judged by how we treat our weakest member or how we reward
    our strongest?</p>

  <p>To white, this is an issue of social responsibility, of looking out
    for the welfare of all. White thinks of black as immoral, caring only
    about selfish concerns. White sees this conflict as that of good versus
    evil.</p>

  <p>To black, this is an issue of personal responsibility, of creating a
    system that pushes people to be their best. Black thinks of white as
    enabling the weak, keeping them victims rather than trying to encourage
    them to improve. Black sees this conflict as encouragement versus
    coddling.</p>

  <p>At its core, this conflict is about how individuals prioritize the decisions they make.</p>

  <h3>Head vs. Heart (Blue vs. Red)</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_UR.png"></p>

  <p>Blue believes in the power of intellect. Improving oneself requires
    mental fortitude. You need to be mindful, focused, careful, and patient.
    Each step must be meticulously managed to ensure that you are always
    advancing in the right direction toward your ultimate goal. Listen to
    your head, for it will always guide you down the correct path.</p>

  <p>Red believes in the power of emotion. Your body speaks to you, and
    it's crucial that you not only listen but act spontaneously and with
    passion. The key to happiness is listening to your gut and never having
    to live with the regret of not chasing your dreams. Follow your heart,
    for it will always guide you down the correct path.</p>

  <p>In short, this is the classic battle of the head versus the heart. Do
    you listen to your intellect or your emotions? Are you guided by what
    you think or how you feel? Should you act with caution or abandon? Which
    will guarantee more happiness: carefully executed logic or passionately
    followed impulses?</p>

  <p>To blue, this is an issue of taking the time to get the details of
    your life correct. Blue thinks of red as needlessly brash and
    dangerously negligent. Blue sees this conflict as carefulness versus
    recklessness.</p>

  <p>To red, this is an issue of understanding and acting on the things
    that matter most to you. Red thinks of blue as cold and detached. Red
    sees this conflict as passion versus indifference.</p>

  <p>At its core, this conflict is about how we live our lives.</p>

  <h3>Free Will vs. Destiny (Black vs. Green)</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_BG.png"></p>

  <p>Black believes that you are responsible for creating the
    opportunities that advance you in life. There is no obstacle that cannot
    be overcome if you are willing to do what is necessary. The key is
    understanding the power you have within you to bring about change.</p>

  <p>Green believes that the path you take in life is predetermined; you
    have a role to fill that you were born for. Your job is to figure out
    what exactly that path is, embrace it, and then dutifully fulfill that
    role. There will be distractions in life that will lead you astray, but
    you need to have the fortitude to keep returning to your destiny.</p>

  <p>In short, this is the classic battle of free will versus destiny. How
    much control do you have over the outcome of your life? Is each choice
    you make your own or is it part of some larger plan? Can you change what
    life has planned for you or is the path already mapped out?</p>

  <p>To black, this is an issue of having the strength to recognize that
    you control your future. Black thinks of green as a fool who believes in
    things that don't actually exist. Black sees this conflict as
    opportunity versus superstition.</p>

  <p>To green, this is an issue of accepting the patterns inherent in the
    world. Green thinks of black as a cynic that can't see the truth in
    front of them. Green sees this conflict as truth versus skepticism.</p>

  <p>At its core, this conflict is about the role you play in your life.</p>

  <h3>Freedom vs. Security (Red vs. White)</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_RW.png"></p>

  <p>Red believes that the goal of life is for each person to find their own passion by following their
    impulses.</p>

  <p>To be able to do this, they need to live in a society that
    prioritizes the needs of the individual to explore whichever path they
    choose to walk down. It needs to be a world free of restrictions and
    limitations.</p>

  <p>White wants to create a world that maximizes the happiness of the
    group. A key part of accomplishing this is making sure that everyone is
    safe and secure. To do this, there must be rules and regulations that
    ensure individuals don't selfishly endanger the group.</p>

  <p>In short, this is the classic battle of freedom versus security.
    What's best for a society? A world in which people are free to act or
    one in which they are free from harm? Do we prioritize the individual's
    ability to do what they want or a society's ability to best protect
    itself? Is a seat belt law curtailing liberties or saving lives? How
    much personal freedom is worth societal protection?</p>

  <p>To red, this is an issue of whether or not others get to tell you how
    to live your life. Red thinks of white as a dictator unfairly enforcing
    its will. Red sees this conflict as democracy versus fascism.</p>

  <p>To white, this is an issue of social responsibility, of looking out
    for the greater welfare. White sees red as someone embracing anarchy and
    endangering society. White sees this conflict as order versus chaos.</p>

  <p>At its core, this conflict is about what is best for how we govern ourselves.</p>

  <h3>Nature vs. Nurture (Green vs. Blue)</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_GU.png"></p>

  <p>Green believes that each person is born with all the attributes that
    will define it. That its strengths, weaknesses, everything that will
    shape who and what the person is comes from within, from its genetic
    make-up, from its physiology, from its biology.</p>

  <p>Blue believes that each creature is born a blank slate that has the
    potential to become anything. With the proper education, experiences,
    and tools, each person has the ability to choose their own defining
    traits, to become the thing that they decide to be.</p>

  <p>In short, this is the classic battle of nature versus nurture. What
    shapes who we are? Are we born with the qualities that will ultimately
    dictate what we become, or are we something that can be shaped to become
    whatever we desire? Is our potential fixed or unlimited? Are we defined
    by our genes or by our environment? Which is more important: the wisdom
    of our past or the knowledge of our future?</p>

  <p>To green, this is an issue of whether or not people are willing to
    accept themselves for who they were born to be. Green thinks of blue as
    someone who is unwilling to accept the truth of who they truly are.
    Green sees this conflict as acceptance versus denial.</p>

  <p>To blue, this is an issue of whether or not people are willing to
    embrace the world of possibility before them. Blue thinks of green as
    someone unwilling to change. Blue sees this conflict as opportunity
    versus stagnation.</p>

  <p>At its core, this conflict is about identity and how we see ourselves.</p>



  <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the conflicts of the color
    wheel is that each color is fundamentally fighting for the same thing
    against each of its enemies.</p>

  <h3>White vs. Black and Red</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_WBR.png"></p>

  <p>White wants peace. White wants to take steps to maximize the quality
    of life for every person. Its conflicts are against the two forces that
    are most likely to stop that: selfishness and recklessness. White has
    used order as a tool to help society make good choices. It has crafted
    moral and civil laws. It has created religion and government.</p>

  <p>White's conflict with black is about morality. White protects the
    weak by making people understand that it's their moral responsibility to
    look after those in need. Black undermines this by questioning whether
    morality even exists. It preys upon people's selfishness to lure them to
    only look after their own needs.</p>

  <p>White's conflict with red is about civility. White protects the weak
    by making rules that punish those who take advantage of them. Red
    undermines this by questioning the need for these laws. It plays into
    the dislike that people have for being told what to do.</p>

  <p>White's conflict is one of upholding structure in the wake of forces
    that want to tear it down or even prevent it from being created in the
    first place.</p>

  <h3>Blue vs. Red and Green</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_URG.png"></p>

  <p>Blue wants perfection. Blue wants to do everything it can to create
    the best version of itself and its society. Its conflicts are against
    the two forces that push against that goal: shortsightedness and
    resistance to change. Blue uses knowledge as a tool to inform
    individuals of the potential of which they are capable. It supports
    teaching, training, and the creation of tools that allow people to
    become something bigger and better. It has created education and
    technology.</p>

  <p>Blue's conflict with red is about restraint. Blue teaches that
    through careful deliberation and planning, a person can map out their
    future. Red undermines this by always thinking short term and making
    spontaneous decisions that are destructive long term. It takes advantage
    of humans' impulsive nature to seek instant gratification.</p>

  <p>Blue's conflict with green is about willingness to change. Blue is on
    the cutting edge of technology, always using its quest for knowledge to
    find new answers to life's problems. Green undermines this by
    questioning the sanctity of change. It takes advantage of human's
    habitual nature and inherent fear of new things.</p>

  <p>Blue's conflict is one of pushing toward slow, deliberate change in the wake of forces that seek to
    circumvent or stop it.</p>

  <h3>Black vs. Green and White </h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_BGW.png"></p>

  <p>Black wants power. Black believes in personal responsibility and
    wants to enable each person with the chance to control their own path in
    life. Its conflicts are against the two forces that want to take away
    choice from the individual: the false concepts of fate and morality.
    Black seeks to make opportunities by allowing people to have choices and
    to earn authority over those choices. It has created the concepts of
    free will and personal empowerment.</p>

  <p>Black's conflict with green is about destiny. Black preaches that
    each person has control over what they choose to do with their life.
    Green undermines this by promoting the concept that a person's life is
    predetermined and that they are obligated to take the path assigned to
    them. It takes advantage of the natural fear people have with
    uncertainty and feeds them a promise of a reward that they don't have to
    earn.</p>

  <p>Black's conflict with white is about realism. Black preaches that the
    one person you can depend upon to support yourself is you. Relying on
    others makes you vulnerable to disappointment or worse. White undermines
    this by promoting a concept that states that the strong are obligated
    to coddle the weak, that people don't deserve more if they work harder.
    It takes advantage of the fact that the weak outnumber the strong and
    gives them a false sense of worth.</p>

  <p>Black's conflict is one of creating a system that rewards merit in the wake of forces that empower
    weakness.</p>

  <h3>Red vs. White and Blue</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_RWU.png"></p>

  <p>Red wants freedom. Red wants the ability to follow its passions
    wherever they may lead. Its conflicts are against the two forces that
    want to put obstacles in its way: caution and impassivity. Red seeks
    action; it encourages people to follow their impulses. It has created
    enthusiasm and spontaneity.</p>

  <p>Red's conflict with white is about the needless creation of rules.
    Red understands that there are dangers in life, but none so problematic
    as a life unlived, of the regret of choices never made. White undermines
    this by pushing an agenda that prioritizes the safety of the group over
    the rights of the individual. It takes advantage of the resistance
    people have to getting hurt.</p>

  <p>Red's conflict with blue is about the push toward inaction. Red
    understands that there are risks arising from unknown factors, but
    dealing with life's bumps is part of the journey. Blue undermines this
    by pushing a belief that problems must be fully understood before
    they're tackled. It takes advantage of human reluctance to making
    mistakes.</p>

  <p>Red's conflict is one of promoting action in the wake of forces that intimidate people into slowing
    down.</p>

  <h3>Green vs. Blue and Black</h3>

  <p><img alt="" src="Pie%20Fights_files/MM20161114_GUB.png"></p>

  <p>Green wants growth. Green believes that the natural system we have is
    perfection and it simply wants to enable it to do its thing without
    outside interference. Its conflicts are the two forces that are trying
    to create unnatural change: the push to change our identity and to
    change our fate. Green wants to foster an acceptance for the natural
    system, to make people realize that we don't need to change to something
    better, that what we already have <em>is</em> the best system. It has created an appreciation for our
    internal nature and our destiny.</p>

  <p>Green's conflict with blue is about the rejection of genetics, of
    this erroneous belief that we can change our fundamental nature. Green
    understands that we are born with the attributes that will define us.
    Blue undermines this by pushing the belief that people can become
    something other than who they truly are. It takes advantage of the human
    desire to dream and imagine ourselves as being fundamentally different
    from how we were born.</p>

  <p>Green's conflict with black is about the rejection of fate. Green
    understands that the journey of life is coming to understand what role
    we play in the larger web of life and then embracing that role and
    fulfilling it. Black undermines this by pushing the belief that people
    can escape their destiny, that subverting the interconnection between
    living things will lead to something other than disaster. It takes
    advantage of the human pull to explore the dark side of nature.</p>

  <p>Green's conflict is one of creating acceptance of the world around us
    in the wake of forces trying to change that world into something it is
    not.</p>



  <p>One of the things you're taught as you learn creative writing is that
    fiction is, at its core, about conflict. The protagonist wants
    something and the antagonist, be it a person, force, or internal
    conflict, tries to stop the protagonist from getting it. The color pie
    has a similar quality in that it's balanced by each color's wants and
    desires being offset by those of its enemies. I hope today's column has
    demonstrated that the true beauty is not just the isolated philosophies
    of the five colors but of their relationship with one another.</p>

  <p>To boil the conflicts down for a single column, I simplified them a
    bit. As you explore them, you'll see that any single conflict has many
    different facets. Two different stories, for instance, could be created
    with a red vs. white conflict without the stories being similar. (<em>The Dark Knight</em>, for example,
    is a far cry from <em>Ferris Buehler's Day Off</em>.)</p>
