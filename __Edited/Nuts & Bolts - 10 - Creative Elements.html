  <h1>Nuts &amp; Bolts: Creative Elements</h1>

  <p>You've made your design skeleton, filled it, playtested it, iterated it,
    evolved it, troubleshot it, and evaluated it. Now, I'm going to
    discuss something that goes on concurrently with all the design work:
    the creative elements of the set. By that, I am referring to the name,
    flavor text, card concepts, and worldbuilding (plus art if you have
    any). At Wizards, there's an entire team dedicated to these elements of
    the set, but it's still part of the designer's job to interact with this
    team and to make sure that the design itself is interwoven with flavor.
    At home, it's usually the job of the designer to do most (or all) of
    the creative work. This column is going to talk about how to
    incorporate the creative elements into your design.</p>

  <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>

  <p>To start with, usually before you begin a design, you have some idea
    of the world you're going to be playing around in. We refer to a design
    as "top-down" if the flavor of the world drives your design (examples
    being <em>Innistrad</em>, <em>Theros</em>, and <em>Amonkhet</em>) and "bottom-up" if the mechanics drive
    it (examples being <em>Ravnica</em>, <em>Zendikar</em>, and <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>),
    so I want to begin by talking about how each element plays into early
    design. I'm going to break this down into three phases: initial (where
    you start building your set from scratch), adaptive (where you have to
    bring in the element you haven't focused on yet), and combining (where
    you are interweaving the two). For each phase, I'll talk about how
    top-down and bottom-up designs handle it.</p>

  <h2>Initial Phase</h2>

  <h3>Top-Down </h3>

  <p>Usually you start a top-down design by asking: What would the audience expect in a world of this known
    flavor? <em>Innistrad</em> wanted monsters. <em>Theros</em> wanted gods. <em>Amonkhet</em>
    wanted archetypal Egyptian things (mummies, pyramids, scarabs, etc.).
    My technique for the first meeting with my design team is to list
    everything we can think of. I then ask my designers to use those ideas
    as inspirations for the earliest cards and mechanics. <em>Innistrad</em>
    wants monsters? Okay, what kind? Werewolves? How would we design a
    Werewolf that captures the expectation? It was this path that led us to
    double-faced cards.</p>

  <p>The key here is to use the flavor as the guiding force to figure out
    your vision for the set. Most of your cards should have playtest names
    that are evocative and resonant. My technique is to label cards after
    the trope you're trying to hit. I called the Vampire lord "Count
    Dracula," not because I thought the final execution would be similar,
    but because I wanted my fellow designers to understand the purpose the
    card was serving in the set.</p>

  <p>The trick with top-down sets is that the flavor is instrumental in
    how the set is structured, because you're going to want your structure
    to reinforce your themes, which are being guided by your source
    material. <em>Innistrad</em>'s cohesion wasn't mechanical, but rather
    linked together through the flavor. This means for this type of design,
    you need to start incorporating your flavor from the beginning.</p>

  <h3>Bottom-Up </h3>

  <p>With a bottom-up set, you don't need to worry about flavor quite as
    early. It's fine if you have some idea about your creative elements, but
    you can make use of functional (Small Blast) or silly (This Is Gonna
    Hurt) playtest names. The adventure world theme of <em>Zendikar </em>didn't happen for many months. The
    same is true of the city and guild flavor for original <em>Ravnica</em> and the warlords/Sarkhan's home
    plane flavor of <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>.</p>

  <p>If the core of your set is mechanical, what you're going to want to
    do early is figure out the relationship between the mechanics; you can
    focus less on the flavor. <em>Zendikar</em> messed around with mechanics interacting with lands and <em>Ravnica</em>
    made cycles of each two-color combination. Focus your early energies on
    whatever is the glue of your structure so that you can start building
    your design skeleton to match.</p>

  <p>The trick with bottom-up sets is that the flavor is secondary to the
    structure and thus doesn't have to be figured out quite as early. That
    doesn't mean that you can't have ideas for where your set takes place,
    but you have less obligation to have that guide your design.</p>

  <h2>Adaptive Phase</h2>

  <h3>Top-Down</h3>

  <p>Once you have a handle on your setting and theme, you have to start
    to piece together what your mechanical structure needs to be. I'll use <em>Innistrad</em>
    again as an example. We knew we wanted monsters, we knew we wanted
    death to matter, we knew we wanted to evoke a sense of fear, and we knew
    we wanted dark transformation. The monsters led us down a path where we
    started listing the types of monsters we wanted: vampires, werewolves,
    zombies, and spirits, with humans as victims. As we started placing them
    into colors, we began to see a pattern: the five tribes were falling
    naturally into ally color combinations. We added a little bit of a
    tribal component, and all of a sudden, the gameplay started to feel like
    monsters were an integral part of it.</p>

  <p>Death mattering and evoking a sense of fear got us to look at the
    graveyard and care about whether things have died. That got us to look
    at graveyard mechanics and to experiment with a new mechanic that
    checked if something had died that turn. These explorations led directly
    to bringing back flashback and creating morbid.</p>

  <p>The dark transformation started by us focusing on making Werewolves
    work mechanically, but eventually led us to double-faced cards that
    allowed us to tell stories where innocent things could transform into
    darker, scarier things. Once we had the double-faced technology, we
    started finding all the different horror tropes we could hit with it.</p>

  <p>The key here is that we let the flavor drive the goals for the set
    but then used mechanics as a way to reinforce those themes. Monster
    tribal, flashback, morbid, and double-faced cards/transform were each a
    result of us finding a mechanical execution that allowed the gameplay to
    capture the overall feel that was driving our design.</p>

  <h3>Bottom-Up</h3>

  <p>Once you have a sense of what you want mechanically, you have to
    start asking yourself, what kind of a world would the mechanics make
    sense in? I'll use original <em>Zendikar </em>as my example for this
    section. We started by focusing on land mechanics. We eventually settled
    on landfall as our main focus, along with various other ways to
    reference or care about lands. We then had to ask ourselves, what kind
    of world would allow us to focus on lands? We also knew that caring
    about lands meant you would have more lands in total in the set, putting
    another restriction on the setting.</p>

  <p>This exploration led us to realize that what we wanted was a world
    where people versus environment was the driving source of conflict. That
    meant the land had to play a more active role. Digging into this was
    what led us to an adventure world where the adventurers had to overcome a
    hostile environment. The people were trying to survive against a world
    that was actively trying to kill them.</p>

  <p>Once we latched onto the genre, we were free to start exploring the
    many different subgenres. The subgenres then led us to lists of tropes
    and resonant clusters, which we collected into lists.</p>

  <h2>Combining Phase</h2>

  <h3>Top-Down</h3>

  <p>The point of this phase is to take your two elements, creative and
    mechanical, and start integrating them. For a top-down set, what this
    usually means is examining your flavor elements and finding
    opportunities to tie them together mechanically. With <em>Innistrad </em>for
    instance, this is the point where we examined each of our monster races
    and started to give them a mechanical theme. We chose to make Zombies
    slower and controlling. We made Vampires more aggressive. We integrated
    the Werewolves with the double-faced cards and figured out a unified
    trigger that would turn Humans into Werewolves and a different trigger
    that would turn Werewolves back into Humans.</p>

  <p>We also examined all our different top-down card designs and tried to
    find places where we could incorporate our mechanics. We had a spell
    that produced a huge number of Zombies to capture the idea of being
    overwhelmed by a Zombie horde. What if we added flashback to that spell
    so you could make a giant horde of Zombies not once but twice?</p>

  <p>The trick in this phase is trying to mix and match flavor and
    mechanics in such a way that the audience won't be able to tell where
    you started from. I bring up top-down and bottom-up because they are
    radically different from the designer's side of things, but when a set
    is done well, the audience shouldn't necessarily be able to distinguish
    how it was made.</p>

  <h3>Bottom-Up</h3>

  <p>Once we know our world, in a bottom-up design, we want to dedicate some mechanical space to things
    inspired by the world. For <em>Zendikar</em>,
    that meant finding some elements of adventure world flavor and building
    some mechanics around it. We explored a lot of ideas but ended up with
    what we, at the time, called "traps, maps, and chaps." Traps became the
    trap mechanic, which allowed you to cast cards at a reduced cost if the
    opponent performed a certain game action. Maps became quests, an
    enchantment mechanic where you were asked to do the same feat multiple
    times and were rewarded when you did it enough times. Chaps became
    Allies, a tribal theme that allowed creatures with the Ally creature
    type to work together, much like an adventuring party.</p>

  <p>You'll notice with both top-down and bottom-up that we save some
    design space to allow elements of the opposite component to be built in
    later. Top-down sets leave room for flavor to be layered on top of
    mechanics, while bottom-up sets leave mechanical room to design based on
    the flavor once it's decided.</p>

  <p>Now that we've walked through early design, let me give some
    practical tips about when and where to incorporate creative elements.</p>

  <h2>Names</h2>

  <p>If you're doing a top-down design, you're going to want your design
    names to help shape the feel of the set. Early on, it's fine to
    reference the trope or inspiration directly in the name. The key is
    ensuring the people playing with the card get the flavor you're trying
    to capture. For top-down, the early playtest names are less important.
    You need playtest names so you can refer to cards, but the names can be
    on the more practical or sillier side if you wish.</p>

  <p>Once you move out of the initial design, around the time you're going
    to want to start having outsiders playtest your sets, you're going to
    need to start coming up with more realistic names. Top-down sets are
    going to need to shift away from trope references to actual names you'll
    want to use on your cards. Bottom-up sets are going to need to get a
    sense of what each card represents.</p>

  <p>The best way to think of this phase is by comparing it to something
    we do at Wizards. We need to have an artist illustrate the card. Before
    we can do that, we need to do what we call card concepting. What exactly
    does that spell represent? Let's say, for example, it's a direct-damage
    spell that can hit a creature or player for 3. What exactly is the
    spell doing? Is it using fire? Or lava? Or heat? Or earth? Or sound?
    What exactly is the spell doing physically with the magic? If it's a
    creature, this is where we figure out what creature type it is (if the
    card has tribal concerns, usually the design team has already indicated
    that it needs to be a certain tribe) and what kind of role it plays.</p>

  <p>While many of you might not be putting art on your cards, going
    through the exercise of what your card would show if it had art is a
    good way to approach creating real names. Here are some tips on names:</p>

  <p><strong>Avoid real <em>Magic</em> card names</strong> &mdash; If you call a spell <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Lightning+Bolt">Lightning
      Bolt</a>,
    many players will read the title and stop reading. They know what it
    does. Even if they understand that it's a different spell, it will still
    cause confusion and lead to players comparing your card with the named
    version, which will warp your playtesting notes.</p>

  <p><strong>Don't use words associated with other colors</strong> &mdash;
    Because the color philosophy has become so engrained in how we name
    cards, putting the wrong word on a card will throw people. Maybe you
    intend your Fire Rhino to be green, but the mere presence of the word
    "Fire" will make players assume it's red.</p>

  <p><strong>Make sure the name implies what the spell does</strong> &mdash; The
    card name has a function, and that's to help the player remember what
    it does. Having a name that implies something different than what the
    card is doing will cause players to misplay it.</p>

  <p><strong>Name the card so it matches the type of spell it is</strong> &mdash;
    Creatures should sound like creatures. Instants and sorceries are
    usually named with verbs to imply action. Artifacts are physical
    objects. Enchantments are intangible concepts or magic. Lands are a
    place. Planeswalkers should be given character names. You want to match
    expectations with card names, not fight them.</p>

  <p><strong>Avoid <em>Magic</em> lingo that contradicts your card's function</strong>
    &mdash; If you call a card "Mill," players will assume it forces the opponent
    to put cards from their library to their graveyard even if it doesn't
    do that. <em>Magic</em> has spent 25 years building up a vocabulary and
    assigning meaning to various terms. Fighting that vocabulary will result
    in players jumping to incorrect conclusions.</p>

  <p><strong>Try to use names that actually fit on a real <em>Magic</em> card</strong> &mdash; While it's funny in
    early playtest to have very long names, if those are used on "real" cards it makes them feel less real.</p>

  <p><strong>Make sure your card names sound different from one another</strong> &mdash; This is a problem <em>Magic</em>
    has had over the years, with <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=207913"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;multiverseid=207913">Quick
      Sliver</a> and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393945" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;multiverseid=393945">Clickslither</a>
    being the most famous mistake. Having your cards sound too similar just
    leads to players playing one card assuming it's another.</p>

  <p><strong>When making up proper names, make sure people can pronounce the names</strong>
    &mdash; The trick I use is to show the name to someone unfamiliar with it in a
    vacuum and see if they can pronounce it. If they can't do it instantly
    and easily, I change the name.</p>

  <p><strong>Be stingy with "25 cent" words</strong> &mdash; That's the R&amp;D
    slang for words that the average player doesn't know. A few at high
    rarities are okay, but it's an element that works best in small volume.</p>

  <h2>Creature Type</h2>

  <p>While the creature type can be mechanically relevant, most of the
    time, it's more about adding flavor to the card. Think carefully about
    what you'd like each creature to be. Combined with names and flavor
    text, this can lead to cards that liven the player's imaginations.</p>

  <p>Some tips on creature types:</p>

  <p><strong>Don't always default to the most commonly used creature types</strong> &mdash; It's easy to make every
    red creature a Goblin, but that will lead your set to feel less rich.</p>

  <p><strong>Humanoid creatures can have both a race and a class</strong> &mdash;
    The race is what they are and the class is what job they perform. It's
    not essential that all humanoids have both a race and a class, though.
    Usually when we leave one off it's the class.</p>

  <p><strong>You can have multiple creature types</strong> &mdash; A lot of fun
    can come from combining different things into one creature. Just be
    careful of the card type line length. Your creature types all have to
    fit. Legendary creatures are the ones that most frequently run into
    space issues.</p>

  <p><strong>Be creative</strong> &mdash; You're making up new cards; you can also make up new creature types.</p>

  <h2>Flavor Text</h2>

  <p>Besides names and creature types, the one other place to show off
    your world and characters is in flavor text. If you feel uncomfortable
    writing it, chances are you know someone who would enjoy creating some.</p>

  <p>As far as flavor text, here's my advice:</p>

  <p><strong>It's not mandatory</strong> &mdash; You can have a successful set
    without flavor text. If you're intimidated by writing flavor text, and
    you can't find someone else to help, it's okay to leave it off.</p>

  <p><strong>More is less</strong> &mdash; If you're unsure whether or not
    flavor text will fit, leave it off. Wordy cards are intimidating, so
    there's no reason to compound that problem by adding flavor text where
    it's unneeded.</p>

  <p><strong>Use the flavor text to aid comprehension of the spell</strong>
    &mdash; Sometimes the name and concept are a little removed from the
    mechanics of the card. Flavor text can do a good job of reinforcing the
    connection between the two.</p>

  <p><strong>Use flavor text to build your world</strong> &mdash; There are not a
    lot of ways to let people know about your world. We have the luxury of
    art and an entire worldbuilding team, which you probably won't have, so
    use flavor text as a way to convey important information about your
    world.</p>

  <p><strong>Use flavor text to build your characters</strong> &mdash; Quotes from a character do a much better job
    of helping players grasp who that character is than explanatory text.</p>

  <p><strong>Remember that the best flavor text works in isolation</strong>
    &mdash; What makes flavor text fun is that it's bite-sized and doesn't
    require additional information to comprehend. Keep that in mind when
    creating it.</p>

  <p>Before we wrap up, there's one last thing I want to stress. Your mechanics <em>are</em>
    a creative element. How they play will shape how the audience perceives
    your flavor. Yes, you should spend time on names, creature types, and
    flavor text (and art if you're able), but don't forget to make sure your
    mechanics themselves are integrated with the flavor so that the act of
    playing your set makes the player feel something. <em>Magic</em>'s best
    successes have come when the mechanics and flavor are so intertwined
    that they feel like a singular thing rather than two components.</p>
