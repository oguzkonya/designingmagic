  <h1>Design 104</h1>
  <p>I have four more mistakes to share with you, but before I can
    talk about them I must first talk about a book on creative thinking. No,
    I'm not talking about my favorite book, <i>A Whack on the Side of the Head</i> by Dr. Roger von Oech
    (although, as always, if you haven't read it I implore you too). Rather, I am talking about <i>A Kick
      In The Seat Of The Pants</i>, the sequel to <i>A Whack On The Side Of The Head</i>. While it's not
    quite as good as <i>Whack</i>, it's still well worth the read. </p>
  <p> I bring up <i>A Kick In The Seat Of The Pants</i> because, in it, von Oech describes the creator as
    taking on four distinct roles. <b>The explorer</b> seeks out new areas for ideas, <b>the artist</b>
    crafts the ideas, <b>the judge</b> decides whether the ideas are worthy, and <b>the warrior</b>
    fights for the worthy ideas. I have decided for today's list of
    mistakes to take one from each of the creative roles. I will go in the
    order that the roles are used. </p>
  <h3> The Explorer's Mistake&mdash;"It Hasn't Been Done" Is Not a Reason to Do Something </h3>
  <p>People
    ask me all the time how I start making a set. Do I begin with a place
    or a mood or a tone or a mechanic or a cycle of cards or possibly even
    just a single card? Where do I start? The answer is there is no one
    starting point. Each set starts from its own vantage point. I have begun
    from mechanical places; I've begun from flavorful places. The correct
    answer is that any place is a viable jumping-off spot if it can provoke
    you into building from it.</p>
  <p>This lesson is about the danger of
    choosing the wrong motivation in finding your jumping off point. It can
    also be the same mistake that makes you design a card that you shouldn't
    be designing. What exactly is that mistake? Making choices not on the
    design itself but on some criteria external to the design. What
    criteria? I'm glad you asked.</p>
  <p>Game designers are by their nature
    game players. If you cannot enjoy the medium you are crafting, you will
    be a poor craftsman/artist. Because game designers are game players,
    they have a strong desire to challenge themselves. I believe for most
    game designers, game design itself is a game to them. It has all the
    markings of an awesome game. You have an end goal with lots of rules to
    structure what you can and can't do. The problem with this mindset is
    that it can force a designer to make choices based on the challenge
    rather than the task at hand.</p>
  <p> In <b>Magic</b> design, one of the most dangerous challenges is "We haven't done that yet." <b>Magic</b>
    is an ever-changing game that in its twenty-year history has explored
    vast amounts of design space. Finding something the game hasn't done yet
    is intoxicating and definitely a "throw the gauntlet down" type of
    challenge. It's a trap, though. </p>
  <p>First, if the game hasn't done
    something for twenty years, odds are there's a reason. Second, just
    because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it's good or it will be fun.
    But wait, we've done all sorts of crazy things. Yes, but in the case of
    our successes, we didn't set out to do them; rather, we found them
    because they were an answer to another problem.</p>
  <p> Let's take double-faced cards. We didn't start by saying, "<b>Magic</b> cards have always had a <b>Magic</b>
    back, what if we broke that rule?" We started by trying to represent
    dark transformations, as we realized that this was both key to capturing
    werewolves and hitting a major trope of horror. Double-faced cards were
    one of our ideas how to solve it. I tried many more straightforward
    solutions but when they didn't work, I tried double-faced cards, which
    ended up doing exactly what we wanted. </p>
  <p>The key is that if we had
    started with double-faced cards, we might never have found something
    that worked, but by getting there because it solved our problem, we
    ended up with a tight mechanical-to-flavor fit. This way, when we ended
    up doing something radical, we knew we could support it because it was
    integral to the design.</p>
  <p>The trick when you want to do something
    different is to keep it in mind as an option and wait for the right
    problem for when it's an elegant solution. Note that this might be a
    long time, but if you have enough ideas, some of them will find homes.
    There are many important skills to doing design&mdash;patience being an
    important one.</p>

  <h3>The Artist's Mistake&mdash;You Try to Be Too Literal</h3>
  <p>One
    of the lessons of creative expression is that while different arts use
    different mediums, the same set of rules apply. For this next lesson, I
    am going to start talking about painting. Let me stress that I have
    never taken a class in painting but I have had friends who are painters,
    and this following lesson came up when I was talking about something I
    was doing with my writing.</p>
  <p>One of the things they have you do in
    art class is draw objects: a bowl of fruit, a vase, a model. Early on,
    the goal is getting you to try to capture something on paper that looks a
    lot like what you are drawing. Can you capture the image as faithfully
    as possible? Then, though, they start trying to get you to represent the
    image using less. A popular assignment is to get you to draw something
    using as few lines as possible. Why do they do this? Because they want
    you to understand that you don't need all the information to convey what
    something is.</p>
  <p>Here's a similar experiment you can do yourself.
    Write your name in big block letters in pencil. Now start erasing bits
    of lines using the following criteria: Try to make sure your name is
    still recognizable. That is, if you showed it to someone else, that
    person could read it. What you will find is that you can actually erase
    quite a lot and still have the name be readable. Why is that? Because
    the human brain is very good at filling things in, especially things
    it's familiar with.</p>
  <p> So what does any of this have to do with <b>Magic</b>
    design? A lot. Your goal when you are designing a card, much like a
    painter painting a picture, is to get your audience to recognize the
    thing you are making. It is not to be as thorough as possible. In many
    ways, card design is a lot like the line sketch from art class. You are
    trying to create an object using as few resources as possible. </p>
  <p>
    Why is that? Because elegance is important in game design. The more you
    have, the more text is needed to convey it and the more complicated the
    card becomes. To quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry">Antoine de
      Saint-Exupery</a>
    (a French writer and poet from the early twentieth century):
    "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when
    there is nothing left to take away." </p>
  <p>When trying to capture
    something on a card, especially in top-down design, remember that you do
    not need to capture everything, just the essence. The flavor of the
    card will help fill in the audience. They will not expect exact
    duplication but rather a feel that matches expectation. Let's say you
    are trying to make a slingshot. The audience doesn't start with "Well,
    what would a slingshot do?" Players look at your card and ask
    themselves, "Is this a slingshot?"</p>
  <p>To get a "yes," you need to
    capture some essence of a slingshot&mdash;you do not need to capture every
    essence. The key to this lesson is figuring out the more important
    aspect and focusing on that.</p>
  
    <h3>The Judge's Mistake&mdash;The Card is Awesome but Not For This Set</h3>
  <p> A big part of design is killing cards. I've been designing <b>Magic</b>
    cards for eighteen years and still my hit rate of cards I make to cards
    that see print is under 5%. Why? Because part of figuring out what your
    set is about is trying different things. Not everything works out, but
    that's okay, because the act of creation is one of discovery, as you
    figure out what your set needs. </p>
  <p>Killing cards is hard because the
    creative act is a personal one and you tend to get emotionally attached
    to the work you do. Note that this is perfectly normal. It's the
    emotional investment that pulls out the best work from many artists, but
    that means when it's time to be the judge of your own work, you have to
    make the tough calls.</p>
  <p> In <b>Magic</b> design, a designer takes
    on all four of the roles I talk about above. The one I find that most
    designers have the greatest difficulty with is the role of judge. They
    can search out areas for ideas, they can make the ideas, and they can
    fight for them, but many designers have trouble figuring out how to
    separate their good card ideas from their bad. </p>
  <p>This mistake,
    though, comes about when a designer identifies a card as a good design
    in a vacuum and doesn't see that it's not a good fit for the set it's
    in. The judging process is supposed to have two parts. First, you have
    to figure out if the card is a good design. Then you have to figure out
    if it's a good design for the set it's in. Quite often, I see card
    designers deem a card worthy of the first test and skip past the second.</p>
  <p> The reasoning behind this is a solid one. Good <b>Magic</b>
    cards are hard to make. When you create one, you want to get it into
    print. But leaving in a good card or even a great card or even an
    awesome card is doing your set a disservice if that good/great/awesome
    card doesn't have the room to live up to its potential. </p>
  <p>How can
    you tell if your wonderful card isn't working out? Playtesting. Remember
    to judge your card not just on its own merits but in how it plays when
    you play it with the set you want to include it in. If the card lacks
    synergy or plays clunky or possibly doesn't even get played, that's a
    big clue that perhaps the right thing to do with your cool design is to
    put it aside and wait for a future set that it will serve better.</p>
  <p>This
    is a particularly hard problem for novice card designers because they
    have no promise of seeing a set beyond the first one they work on. But
    if your goal is to make your set the best it can be, you have to be
    willing to let individual cards, no matter how great they are, go. It's
    one of the toughest things in creative works to do&mdash;kill something you
    love. But if a set can live without it, if it's not enhanced by its
    inclusion, keeping it in undercuts the rest of your set.</p>
  <h3>The Warrior's Mistake&mdash;You Can't Fight For Everything</h3>
  <p>The
    lead designer's job doesn't end when the set is handed over from design
    to development. It is his or her responsibility to look over
    development's shoulder and make sure that none of the changes being made
    to the set are destroying the vision. Be aware that it is development's
    job to be a second set of eyes and it's going to be aggressive in
    making the set the best it can be.</p>
  <p>This means development might
    change mechanics or add mechanics or subtract mechanics. Cards will be
    pulled and switched. Color associations may be changed. A lot can shift.
    The trick for the designer, though, is learning what actually matters. A
    very common mistake for a designer's first lead is to try and protect
    every design decision. Obviously, the designers thought long and hard
    about each decision made, so if even a single change is attempted, they
    are very protective. This mindset is dangerous and will lead to a less
    successful set.</p>
  <p>Here's why. Not every decision the lead designer
    made is correct. One of the reasons we have two different teams handle a
    set is that the development team comes in with a fresh perspective. It
    does not have the preconceptions that the design team picked up during
    design. For example, the design team might have reached a decision about
    something and then the set changed, making the earlier decision no
    longer valid. When you are so close to something, it's hard to always
    have the vantage point you need to understand these types of changes.</p>
  <p>On
    the flip side, as the lead designer, you are going to understand the
    set in ways that the development team will not. It is your vision.
    Things that are obvious to you might not be to the development team.
    That is why it's crucial for you to be involved. The trick here is
    separating your biases that came from working on the set from your
    vision that needs to guide it.</p>
  <p> The metaphor I like to use is that
    you are the architect. The development team is going to come in and
    restructure your building. You know where the bearing walls are, though.
    For those unaware of construction, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_wall">bearing wall</a>
    is a wall that the house needs to support itself to stand. Remove a
    bearing wall and the whole house will collapse. You, as the lead
    designer, need to know your bearing walls. What is the key to your
    design that will make it collapse if the development team removes it? </p>
  <p>Fight
    every change and you are robbing the set of the improvement that
    development will bring (and you'll create a lot of conflict). Fight none
    of the changes and the set could collapse because the foundation of the
    vision wasn't maintained. The key is to figure out what really matters
    and step in when that is threatened.</p>
  <p>The lead developer is
    interested in hearing from the lead designer especially if you are very
    careful about your feedback. When something is changed, step back and
    examine whether it's for the best. All change is not bad. In fact, a
    good development team will find ways to improve upon the ideas of
    design. The last thing you want to do is interfere with development
    making your set better.</p>
