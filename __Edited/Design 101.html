  <h1>Design 101</h1>

  <p>You see, in my job I am often called upon to judge the work of rookie
    card designers. I’ve seen enough that I began to recognize common
    mistakes. So, I thought it would make an interesting column to point out
    many of the novice mistakes made when designing <b>Magic </b>cards.</p>

  <p>I should also note before I continue that my audience for this column
    is for card designers who want to design cards as we do here at Wizards
    of the Coast. If you want to do you own thing and do things we never
    would, more power to you, but this column isn’t for you.</p>

  <h3>Mistake #1 - The Card Is Too Complicated</h3>

  <p>This is far and away, hands down, the most common mistake made by
    novice designers. I’m going to break it down as this problem shows up in
    several different ways:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>The card has too many abilities</b> - For some reason, new
      designers feel a great need to take all their cool ideas and put them on
      the same card. This is problematic for several reasons. First, it
      aesthetically makes the card look bad. I strongly urge designers to mock
      up stickers so they can get an idea of how the card looks. Cards with
      excessively long rules text look bad.</p>

    <p>Second, the more abilities on the card, the more complicated the card
      gets. While this okay occasionally on a random funky rare, the average <b>Magic </b>card needs to be
      simple and straightforward. The best example of this is for you to think of the <b>Magic </b>cards you
      like. More often than not, the more popular cards are not in our tiniest font sizes.</p>

    <p>Third, too many abilities “pull focus.” In design lingo what this
      means is that it keeps the player from focusing on the aspect of the
      card you want them to focus on. If, for example, you have a neat new
      creature ability, you want the player to spend his energies thinking
      about that. Each other ability stuck on the card lessens that focus.</p>

    <p><b>The card has too many flavor “add-ons”</b> - This mistake is the
      adding of extra rules text that gives the card more flavor but
      complicates it as the condition seldom matters. As an example, imagine a
      Dragon that, In addition to its “normal” abilities, didn’t untap
      whenever a Knight was in play. There’s some flavor to the ability; maybe
      the Dragon is afraid of Knights and "hides" from them, but it just
      isn’t going to matter in the vast majority of the games. In addition,
      the ability is very swingy, meaning that once in a blue moon the card
      just gets randomly hosed.</p>

    <p>As I talked about above, excess wordiness is bad. For that reason, a
      designer should not use “add-ons” unless they contribute enough to game
      play. A simple way to do this is keeping track of the abilities when you
      playtest the cards. If the ability never or very seldom comes up, it
      usually isn’t worth the space on the card.</p>

    <b>The card is too hard to understand</b> - A very common response to reading a card file from a new
    designer is, “Huh?”

    <p>Quite often I’ll have to read a card multiple times to understand
      what it does. And sometimes, I never figure it out. Good design leans
      towards simplicity not complexity. If the people you show your cards to
      consistently get confused by the same card, that1s a sign that the card
      is too complicated. And don’t jump in and explain your card. Good design
      has to rest on the laurels of the rules text. If the card can’t explain
      itself, it’s inherently flawed.</p>

    <p><b>The card has too many memory issues</b> - As a general rule of
      thumb, cards that force a player to remember something are troublesome.
      That said, there is some valuable design space that requires
      memorization. The two biggest mistakes in this area are: One, cards that
      require a player to remember too many different things. And two, cards
      that require players to remember a detail unimportant enough that they
      are not constantly reminded. An enchantment where the opponent loses 3
      life whenever he draws a card is memorable. One where he loses 1 life
      whenever a 1/1 creature comes into play is not.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Mistake #2 - The Abilities on the Card Have No Synergy</h3>

  <p>As I explained above, rookie designers love loading their cards with
    lots of abilities. Besides being overwhelming, it also hits another
    major design snafu, lack of synergy. You see, when I design a card, I
    think of it as a single entity. That means that everything on the card
    needs to be working together for the greater good of the card. Remember,
    every card doesn’t need multiple abilities on it, but if you choose to
    use more than one, the abilities have to interconnect in some way.</p>

  <p>For example, let’s suppose I wanted to design a multi-color white and
    green creature. Also suppose I want to give it one white ability and
    one green ability. For the white ability, I choose first strike. Now,
    when I look to the green ability, I’m looking for something that has
    synergy with first strike. Let's walk through some choices:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Basilisk Ability (Destroy any creature damaged by this creature)</b>
      - This ability has synergy because hitting first is extra valuable when
      you get to destroy the creature before it can hit back. (Note that the
      synergy works with the <a>newer template of the basilisk ability</a> and not the <a>older version</a>
      that happens at end of combat.)</p>

    <p><b>Block fliers</b> - This has reasonable synergy as both abilities are combat abilities.</p>

    <p><b>Cannot be countered</b> - The two abilities have nothing to do
      with one another. Cannot be countered is good against blue decks. First
      strike is sort of irrelevant against blue decks as traditionally blue
      has weak creatures to start with.</p>
      <p><img alt="Ranger en-Vec" src="Design%20101_files/Image.jpg" /></p>
    <b>Regeneration</b> - This ability is actually non-synergistic. The
    reason is that first strike is an ability which helps keep a creature
    alive in combat. As is regeneration. While the two have slightly
    different utility, they overlap enough that they aren’t particularly
    interesting together. Alas, poor <a>Ranger en-Vec</a>.



    <p><b>Rootwalla ability (+X/+X once per turn)</b> - This has synergy as an increase in power increases
      the strength of first strike.</p>

    <p><b>Tap for mana</b> - This is anti-synergistic as there is no easy
      way to make use of both abilities on the same turn. If you’re tapping to
      attack and use the first strike, you can’t get mana out of the card.</p>

    <p><b>Trample</b> - This one’s kind of neutral. While there’s no great
      synergy, it’s not anti-synergistic. Also, we tend to put trample on big
      creatures and first strike on small and medium creatures.</p>

    <p><b>Untargetability (Cannot be the target of spells or abilities)</b> -
      This has a little synergy. First strike enhances a creature in combat
      and untargetability lessens a creature’s chances of being destroyed
      outside of combat. Not the best fit, but okay.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As you can see, the higher the synergy, the better the overall card will feel.</p>

  <h3>Mistake #3 - The Card Ignores Basic Design Rules of Magic</h3>

  <p>This mistake plays into the major theme of “Making Magic”: Respect
    the rules. Way too often when I’m looking at cards by a new designer, I
    see cards we simply would never make. The reason we haven’t made much
    green creature kill or red enchantment destruction is not because it
    never dawned on us. It’s because the game shouldn’t have them.</p>

  <p>Here are the major rule-breaking categories:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>The Color Wheel</b> - This is usually the biggest culprit. <b>Magic </b>colors
      are clearly defined. When you design a card that seems like a nice
      simple card that does something the color hasn’t done before (or at
      least hasn’t done since <b>Magic</b>’s early days), think twice about
      why it hasn’t been done yet. If it’s a new, unexplored area, that’s
      great. If it’s an obvious mechanic that you’ve seen done in other
      colors, odds are you’re about to make a mistake.</p>

    <p><b>Card Type Rules</b> - Each card type has certain rules about how
      it functions. Lands produce mana. Enchantments don’t tap. Artifacts have
      generic mana costs. If your card breaks one of the fundamental rules of
      a card type (meaning that it does something that no card of that type
      ever does), ask yourself if the card shouldn’t be of a different type.</p>

    <p><b>General Flavor</b> - Over the years <b>Magic </b>has built up a
      distinctive flavor. Some of this flavor has worked its way into card
      mechanics. These choices were made consciously, so be careful next time
      you design a card that flies in the face of history. Your non-flying
      male angel, for instance, might not be a perfect fit.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The point of this category is not that designers can’t break rules.
    It’s that rules shouldn’t be broken if they don’t need to be. As I’m
    fond of saying: Before you think outside the box, check inside the box
    first.</p>

  <h3>Mistake #4 - The Card Doesn’t Work Within the Rules</h3>

  <p>To be clear, I’m not talking about cards that attack virgin areas of
    the rules. This mistake is about cards that simply don’t work under the
    current existing rules. When you design a card, check with someone you
    know that’s good with the rules. Make sure the card works the way you
    think it works.</p>

  <h3>Mistake #5 - The Card Is Undercosted, Overpowered or Simply “Bah-roken”</h3>

  <p>I understand that no one likes to make a weak card, but too often
    when looking at design files of new designers, I see cards that aren’t
    in the right stratosphere of power. I listed this last because I think
    this is one of the least important design mistakes. (Lord knows I’ve
    made my share of crazy overpowered cards.) But, if you’re serious about
    trying to design your own cards, I would recommend attempting to be
    somewhat close to reality. If this isn’t something you’re good at, use
    your friends that playtest the card. (Me, I just use the developers –
    “Hey Brian, cost this card for me.”)</p>
