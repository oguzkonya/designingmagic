	<h1>Design 103</h1>

	<p>So what’s the biggest mistake I’m seeing in novice designers?
		It’s one I see often with novice designers. Here’s a tip. Just because
		the game is capable of doing something isn’t enough. Just because
		something is interesting in a distant theoretical sense isn’t enough.
		Just because you can imagine the situation where said card would create
		an interesting situation isn’t enough.</p>
	<p><b>Magic</b> is a game. People play <b>Magic</b> for the reason they play any game. It’s fun. It’s
		entertaining to play. It makes them smile. At the core, <b>Magic</b>
		succeeds because it makes people happy. The game in conglomerate and
		the cards in isolation are fun. Sometimes designers get so caught up in
		what they’re doing that they forget this basic point. Today’s column is
		going to examine a number of different ways designers can keep the game
		from being fun.</p>
	<h3>Mistake #1 – Making The Audience Do Something They Don’t Want To Do</h3>
	<p>As
		the saying goes, “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him
		drink.” In game design, think of the horse as the player and drinking
		as having fun. You, the designer, can make the player do anything you
		want, but you can’t make them enjoy it. A good designer makes the game
		fun because he lets the players essentially do what they want to do. </p>
	<p>This
		doesn’t mean you have to let them do whatever they want, but it does
		mean that you have to walk them down paths that they want to walk down.
		Sometimes you can even lead them through something they won’t like if
		it’s on the way to something they really will. Too many designers try to
		force the players to enjoy something they don’t want to. You’re never
		going to win this fight, because when the player gets frustrated enough,
		they quit playing your game. My example for this point comes from Mark
		Globus. This was submitted as his common cycle:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Uncontainable Lightning (common)<br> R<br> Sorcery<br> Uncontainable Lightning deals 3 damage to target
			creature or player.<br> Revenge R (Opponents may play this card from your graveyard for its Revenge cost. Then
			remove it from the game.)</p>
		<p>Uncontainable Delays (common)<br> 1U<br> Sorcery<br> Put target creature on top of its owner's library.<br>
			Revenge 1U (Opponents may play this card from your graveyard for its Revenge cost. Then remove it from the
			game.)</p>
		<p>Uncontainable Health (common)<br> W<br> Sorcery<br> You gain 5 life.<br> Revenge W (Opponents may play this
			card from your graveyard for its Revenge cost. Then remove it from the game.)</p>
		<p>Uncontainable Migraines (common)<br> 1B<br> Sorcery<br> Target player discards two cards.<br> Revenge B
			(Opponents may play this card from your graveyard for its Revenge cost. Then remove it from the game.)</p>
		<p>Uncontainable Growth (common)<br> G<br> Sorcery<br> Search your library for a basic land card and put that
			card into play tapped. Then shuffle your library.<br> Revenge G (Opponents may play this card from your
			graveyard for its Revenge cost. Then remove it from the game.)</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This cycle allows the player to get cheaper spells at
		the cost of a drawback. What’s wrong with this cycle? The drawback –
		allowing your opponent to play your spells. Why? Because players don’t
		want to do this. Who wants to let their opponent play their spells?
		Being on the receiving end of a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer"
		 data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Mindslicer">Mindslicer</a>
		or a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Bribery">Bribery</a>
		is not too much fun, but then your opponent constantly does things to
		you that you don’t like. As a player you understand that in order for
		you to do things to your opponent that you enjoy, he or she is going to
		do them to you. The problem with this cycle is that it asks the player
		to bring this unhappy situation on themselves. </p>
	<p>Making players do
		things they don’t want to do creates unfun moments. This isn’t homework.
		This isn’t a job. This is a game that people choose to play because
		they enjoy it. If it stops being fun, they’re going to stop playing, and
		that’s about a bad a response as you can get as a designer. This cycle
		fails because players don’t want to do what it’s asking them to do. Yes,
		you can bribe them with cheap spells, but in the end, you’re still
		making them do something they don’t want to do.</p>
	<p>So does that mean
		that a designer should never design drawbacks? Of course not. Drawbacks
		can be fun, but the player has to be able to see ways they can navigate
		around the drawback. They have to imagine ways to design a deck that can
		handle the drawback. They have to see the drawback as something they
		are willing to do. Forcing players to do something they don’t want to do
		will almost always result in an unpleasant game experience. Don’t do
		it. (And yes, there are exceptions to this, but I would stress to a
		young designer to learn the craft, then break the rules.)</p>
	<h3>Mistake #2 – Making The Audience Do Unnecessary Work</h3>
	<p>Imagine that you’re at work one day
		and your boss comes up to you and says, “You, grab a shovel.”</p>
	<p>He
		then makes you go outside and start digging a hole. As soon as that
		hole is a few feet deep, he moves you to a new location and has you dig a
		new hole. He keeps doing this until you’ve spent a couple hours digging
		several dozen holes. Finally, you say to him, “Boss, why am I digging
		these holes?”</p>
	<p>The boss then pulls out a small tree. He looks at
		all your holes and then puts it into the one nearest him. When you ask
		how many trees he is planting, he says “Just one.”</p>
	<p>“So why did I dig so many holes?” you ask.</p>
	<p>“To give us more options,” is his reply.</p>
	<p>How
		do you feel in that moment? Pretty angry. Why? Because he wasted your
		time. He really only needed one hole. He made you do a lot of work that
		in the end was for nothing. People pretty much don’t like that. The same
		holds true for game design. Sure you can make your players do whatever
		you tell them. But come the game’s end, the players will be able to tell
		when you’ve wasted their time, and trust me, they won’t be happy about
		it. </p>
	<p>The example of this comes from Christopher Jablonski. This is the common cycle he submitted:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Taboo Elves (common)<br> 1G<br> Creature - Elf Shaman<br> 2/2<br>
			Corrupt 1, T: Add G to your mana pool. (Put a corruption counter on an
			uncorrupt card in play you control as an additional cost to play this
			ability.)</p>
		<p>Student of the Occult (common)<br> 2U<br> Creature - Bird Wizard<br> 2/2<br> Flying; Defender<br>
			Corrupt 1, T: Look at the top three cards of your library, then put
			them back in any order. (Put a corruption counter on an uncorrupt card
			in play you control as an additional cost to play this ability.)</p>
		<p>Bankrupt Preacher (common)<br> 3B<br> Creature - Human Cleric<br> 2/2<br> Fear<br>
			Whenever Bankrupt Preacher deals combat damage to a player, that player
			puts a corruption counter on an uncorrupt card in play he or she
			controls.</p>
		<p>Remorseful Swordsman (common)<br> 1W<br> Creature - Human Knight<br> 2/2<br> First Strike<br>
			Whenever Remorseful Swordsman deals combat damage to a player, put a
			corruption counter on an uncorrupt card in play you control.</p>
		<p>Darkfire Channeler (common)<br> 2R<br> Creature - Dwarf Wizard<br> 2/2<br>
			R, Corrupt 1, T: Darkfire Channeler deals one damage to target creature
			or player. (Pay R and put a corruption counter on an uncorrupt card in
			play you control as an additional cost to play this ability.)</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Let me start by saying that there is actually
		something interesting buried in this cycle. The idea of cards that need
		untainted material to work is flavorful and hints at a mechanical area
		that hasn’t been too deeply explored. But (there’s always a but), it
		creates a lot of busy work. As an example, let’s examine how this cycle
		would affect Sealed. Because the cards are common, you would often see
		them in Limited, but because there are only five, you will often get
		exactly one.</p>
	<p>What does one of these cards do? It starts spreading
		counters over every card you own. While you occasionally might run out
		of permanents, most of the time, if you just have one card with this
		mechanic, you will add cards fast enough that the game will end before
		you deplete your supply. This means that you will often be doing busy
		work adding counters to every permanent you own for no payoff. Not a
		recipe for fun.</p>
	<p>The lesson here is that you have to be very
		careful each and every time you ask something of your players. Make sure
		that there is a high correlation between how much work you ask of them
		and how much they get out of it. When the ratio gets too high, you have
		to reexamine why you’re using that mechanic. </p>
	<h3>Mistake #3 – Don’t Put Things They Care About Out of Their Control</h3>
	<p>Game
		players put a lot of trust in the hands of the designer. (Much in the
		same way that they put trust in a director when they sit themselves down
		in front of a movie screen.) They assume that the designer knows what
		they are doing and follow the paths laid out for them. This is why
		players get so upset when a game isn’t fun. It’s a betrayal of trust.
		They put up their time and attention and the designer didn’t come
		through with the goods.</p>
	<p>This lesson is about a betrayal of this trust. Players are willing to go in blind to a game, or in the case
		of <b>Magic</b> to a new set of cards. They understand that things might not always be as they seem because
		good design, and especially good <b>Magic</b>
		design, throws curveballs at them. Things that might not seem like they
		would be fun often are once you get to start playing with the cards. </p>
	<p>My
		metaphor for this mistake is to imagine that your friend asked you to
		close your eyes. He then tells you to follow his voice. At one point he
		walks you into a wall. It hurts. You get angry. Why? Because you trusted
		your friend to look out for you. When he asked you to close your eyes,
		you believed there was a trust that he would take steps to make sure you
		wouldn’t hurt yourself. Even if he didn’t mean to walk you into a wall,
		it still upsets you, because intentionally or no, he just walked you
		into a wall! Game design is similar to this in that we constantly ask
		players to metaphorically close their eyes. </p>
	<p>My example for this mistake comes from Aaron Weiner. This was his rare cycle:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Weakness: Permanent (rare)<br> U<br> Enchantment—Aura<br> Enchant permanent<br> When ~ comes into play, draw
			2 cards.<br> When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.<br> ~ is indestructible.</p>
		<p>Weakness: Enchantment （rare)<br> W<br> Enchantment—Aura<br> Enchant enchantment<br> When ~ comes into play,
			gain 10 life.<br> When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.<br> ~ is indestructible.</p>
		<p>Weakness: Artifact （rare）<br> B<br> Enchantment—Aura<br> Enchant artifact<br> When ~ comes into play, each
			opponent discards a card, then discards a card at random.<br> When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.<br> ~ is
			indestructible.</p>
		<p>Weakness: Creature (rare)<br> R<br> Enchantment—Aura<br> Enchant creature<br> When ~ comes into play,
			destroy target land.<br> When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.<br> ~ is indestructible.</p>
		<p>Weakness: Land (rare)<br> G<br> Enchantment—Aura<br> Enchant land<br> When ~ comes into play, put a 3/3
			green Spirit creature token into play.<br> When ~ leaves play, you lose the game.<br> ~ is indestructible.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>What’s wrong here? I watched multiple judges read
		this cycle for the first time and each said aloud the same thing: “Lose
		the game?”</p>
	<p>“Lose the game” is the equivalent of dynamite in game
		design. Yes, used properly it can do good, but more than not it’s just
		going to blow up in your face. Why is this implementation so bad?
		Because it violates the player’s trust in a very fundamental way. It
		takes one of the things they care most about (winning the game) and puts
		its fate under the opponent’s control. Is having a very underpriced
		spell worth losing the game if the opponent has the proper removal spell
		in hand (remember these cards force you to destroy the thing being
		enchanted as these enchantments are themselves indestructible)? No, no
		it isn’t.</p>
	<p>One of the easiest shortcuts to figuring out if the
		player is going to like the card is to imagine the following two things.
		What is their first impression of the card? How do they feel when the
		card in play doesn’t go their way? For these cards, I believe both go
		badly. The first impression will be one of disbelief. I assume you’d get
		variations on “Why did they print this card?” </p>
	<p>The worst part, though, is the reaction to the second part. When a player plays this card and then their
		opponent <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Terror">Terror</a>s
		their creature and they lose, they are going to start cussing. Usually
		when a player’s own cards make him regularly curse, there’s signs that
		something’s wrong. This is why the card Lich never took off (and yes, I
		know there are Lich lovers out there). Yeah, it’s cool, but who wants to
		lose the game if their opponent plays enchantment removal?</p>
	<p>The
		lesson here is that you have to think about how the player feels when
		they play your cards. One real negative experience will wipe out lots of
		positive ones. </p>
	<h3>Mistake #4 – You Force The Players Hand Too Much</h3>
	<p>This
		next mistake walks a subtle line. Players like being led to a certain
		extent, but they don’t like being led too much. A while back I talked
		about one spectrum to look at cards (“<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr92"
		 data-type="event-legacy">Come Together</a>”)
		that had to do with how much the card forced you to play with other
		cards. Modular cards were very open ended and could be mixed and matched
		with other card easily. Linear cards forced you to play with certain
		other cards. </p>
	<p>Linear cards aren’t by their nature bad (Slivers, as
		an example, are very popular linear cards), but they do have more
		inherent problems than modular cards. The biggest one is this. Players
		like to feel in charge of their destiny. Especially in a trading card
		game that has a deckbuilding component, players want to have the feeling
		of endless possibilities (but not too endless – one of many great
		challenges of card design). When linear cards get too narrow, they run
		this problem.</p>
	<p>You’ll notice during the first two weeks’ worth of
		judge reviews, Aaron has used the word “parasitic” several times. This
		is a term used by R&amp;D that means that an idea is too self-contained.
		We want players to be able to look at cards and imagine many things
		they can do with them. Cards that are too parasitic say, “No, just look
		at this tiny subset of cards.” When we do this, we start getting the
		“You’re building our decks for us” comments. And you know what? They’re
		right. <b>Magic</b> isn’t fun if the players aren’t given options. </p>
	<p>This mistake has two examples. The first comes from Landon Winkler’s rare cycle:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Beyond the Gate (Rare)<br> 2G<br> Astral Sorcery<br> Search your
			library for any number of astral land cards and remove them from the
			game. Then shuffle your library. Remove CARDNAME from the game.<br>
			Whisper – 1GG: Put target astral land card you own that's removed from
			the game into play. (During your upkeep you may activate one Whisper
			ability from a card you own that is removed from the game.)</p>
		<p>Call of the Gatekeeper (Rare)<br> 3WW<br> Astral Sorcery<br> Remove all astral creatures and CARDNAME from
			the game.<br>
			Whisper - 4WWW: Put a legendary X/X white Angel creature token with
			flying named The Gatekeeper into play, where X is the number of astral
			cards you own removed from the game. (During your upkeep you may
			activate one Whisper ability from a card you own that is removed from
			the game.)</p>
		<p>Gatekeeper's Wisdom (Rare)<br> XUU<br> Astral Sorcery<br> Search
			your library for up to X astral cards and remove them from the game.
			Then shuffle your library. Remove CARDNAME from the game.<br> Whisper –
			2UU: Put target astral instant card that's removed from the game into
			its owner's hand. (During your upkeep you may activate one Whisper
			ability from a card you own that is removed from the game.)</p>
		<p>Gatestorm (Rare)<br> R<br> Astral Sorcery<br> Return CARDNAME to your hand, then remove from the game a card
			at random from your hand.<br>
			Whisper – 1RR: Put target astral creature card that's removed from the
			game into play. It gains haste. Sacrifice it at end of turn. (During
			your upkeep you may activate one Whisper ability from a card you own
			that is removed from the game.)</p>
		<p>Voice in the Mists (Rare)<br> 1B<br> Astral Sorcery<br> Remove CARDNAME and all astral cards in all
			graveyards from the game.<br>
			Whisper - 3BB: Search your deck for a card with the same name as target
			astral card that's removed from the game, reveal it, and put it into
			your hand. Then shuffle your library. (During your upkeep you may
			activate one Whisper ability from a card you own that is removed from
			the game.)</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The second cycle is Andrew Emmott’s rare cycle:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Light Rift (rare)<br> X1W<br> Instant - Rift<br> Search your
			hand, graveyard and library for up to X Rift cards and remove them from
			the game. For each card removed this way, remove target attacking
			creature from the game. Shuffle your library.</p>
		<p>Wind Rift (rare)<br> X3U<br> Instant - Rift<br> Search your hand,
			graveyard and library for up to X Rift cards and remove them from the
			game. For each card removed this way, put target permanent on top of its
			owner's library. Shuffle your library.</p>
		<p>Shadow Rift (rare)<br> XB<br> Instant - Rift<br> Search your
			hand, graveyard and library for up to X Rift cards and remove them from
			the game. For each card removed this way, creatures get -1/-1 until end
			of turn. Shuffle your library.</p>
		<p>Plasma Rift (rare)<br> X1R<br> Instant - Rift<br> Search your
			hand, graveyard and library for up to X Rift cards and remove them from
			the game. For each card removed this way, add RRR to your mana pool.<br> Shuffle your library.</p>
		<p>Force Rift (rare)<br> X2G<br> Instant - Rift<br> Search your
			hand, graveyard and library for up to X Rift cards and remove them from
			the game. For each card removed this way, search your library for a
			creature or land card and put it into your hand.<br> Shuffle your library.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The problem with Astral and Rift as mechanics is that
		they are too parasitic. The worst part is that the power comes from
		playing more of the mechanics meaning that once you commit, you’re
		forced to filled your deck with them (note that both mechanics need to
		have common and uncommon support). This is one of the hardest mistakes
		to avoid, and I’ll be blunt – R&amp;D doesn’t always avoid it. (This
		basic problem was one of my biggest issues with the <i>Champions of Kamigawa</i> block.) </p>
	<p>Nonetheless,
		if you are designing cards, this is an important mistake to understand.
		Players come because they want to play the game. Designers shouldn’t
		play it for them.</p>
	<h3>Mistake #5 – Making Cards Match The Wrong Audience</h3>
	<p>My
		last mistake for today is one of the most subtle and one of the most
		egregious. I often talk in my column about how designers have to
		understand their audience. I also talk often about how different cards
		are made for different audiences. Sometimes a designer intends a card
		for one audience but unknowingly designs it for a different one. </p>
	<p>The best example I can use with <b>Magic</b>
		is the coin flip card. Certain players love coin flipping. (These are
		basically Timmies with a few Johnnies) Others despise it. (Spikes most
		of all.) This means that the designers have to be very careful to make
		coin flipping cards that will appeal to the right player. This is why we
		avoid making tournament relevant coin flipping cards, because if
		they’re good enough, we force Spike to play them. He doesn’t like
		playing them. He doesn’t want his skill-testing to be trumped by factors
		that he has zero control over (<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark%E2%80%99s+Thumb"
		 data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Krark%E2%80%99s+Thumb">Krark’s
			Thumb</a> excepted – but that’s really Johnny’s card). </p>
	<p>It
		is not enough to know the audience for each card. You have to make sure
		to design that card for that audience. The example for this mistake
		comes from Mark Globus (yes, poor Mark gets two examples today). This
		was his uncommon cycle: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The Last of the Elves (uncommon)<br> 2G<br> Enchantment<br> Non-token Elves are Legendary.<br> Elves get
			+1/+1 and cannot be targeted by opponents' spells or effects.</p>
		<p>The Last of the Humans (uncommon)<br> 2W<br> Enchantment<br> Non-token Humans are Legendary.<br> Humans get
			+1/+1 and first strike.</p>
		<p>The Last of the Wizards (uncommon)<br> 2U<br> Enchantment<br> Non-token Wizards are Legendary.<br> Wizards
			get +1/+1 and flying.</p>
		<p>The Last of the Zombies (uncommon)<br> 2B<br> Enchantment<br> Non-token Zombies are Legendary.<br> Zombies
			get +1/+1 and B:Regenerate.</p>
		<p>The Horde of Goblins (uncommon)<br> 2R<br> Enchantment<br> Whenever a non-token Goblin is put in the
			graveyard from play put two 1/1 red Goblin creature tokens into play.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So what’s wrong here? As I said above, this mistake
		is subtler than many of the others seen today. Tribal at its heart is a
		Timmy theme. Before we made Spike care in <i>Onslaught</i>, Spike didn’t
		touch tribal decks with a ten-foot pole (and yes, there are a few
		notable exceptions, but only a few) This cycle is a Spike treatment of
		what want to be Timmy cards. </p>
	<p>Timmy is the one attracted by the lords (<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King"
		 data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Goblin+King">Goblin King</a>,
		<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Undead" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Lord+of+the+Undead">Lord
			of the Undead</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Champion" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Elvish+Champion">Elvish
			Champion</a>,
		etc.) So making Lord-ish enchantments that put a non-Timmy restriction
		creates bad tension. Timmy likes to play four cards of the ones he
		wants. Timmy wants to make the game as fun as possible. This means
		putting as many of the fun cards in his deck as possible. </p>
	<p>The
		problem with this cycle is that Timmy is attracted to one part of the
		card and dislikes the other part. This isn’t a recipe for success. I
		should stress that this cycle isn’t horrible. There are definitely neat
		ideas at work, but in the end, I feel that they would create a net
		negative feeling. The people that most want them to be fun wouldn’t find
		them fun.</p>
	<h3>Fun Police</h3>
	<p>The takeaway from this column is
		this: Don’t forget why you’re designing your cards. You’re making a
		game. Games are intended to be fun, and you can’t force fun. It’s easy
		to get so caught up in the details of your “tree” that you forget about
		the “forest.” Don’t. If a card doesn’t pass the litmus of fun, nothing
		else matters because the audience won’t play it.</p>
