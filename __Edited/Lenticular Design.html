  <h1>Lenticular Design</h1>

  <p>So, a few years back, we realized that the number of new players were
    dropping off. This is a pretty scary thing to realize because it's the
    first sign that a business is in its decline. Retention of your current
    audience is crucial, but people will always leave, often for reasons
    that have nothing to do with the product itself, and in order to
    maintain the playerbase, you have to add new blood.</p>

  <p>We spent a lot of time solving this problem and the answer to it is what we now call New World Order.
    The short version is we decided to cap the level of complexity at
    common because beginning players on average buy fewer boosters and thus a
    great percentage of cards that are relevant to them are common. By
    making the threshold for complexity at common lower, we were simplifying
    the game for beginners, and thus lowering the barrier to entry, while
    still keeping the more advanced cards in the game.</p>

  <p>While working on New World Order, I started to look at game design
    differently. I began to ask myself what impact each individual card was
    having on each type of player. There are a number of different filters I
    started looking through (a topic for a different article), one of which
    was complexity. I asked myself with each card, "How complex is this
    card?" While answering this question, I stumbled on a new concept.</p>

  <p>I think when most people look at complexity, they think of it as a
    scale. They deduce how complicated it is in general and then they place
    it at the appropriate spot. What I realized was that complexity, that is
    how complex a particular card is for a player to comprehend, varied
    from person to person. If you showed the same card to a number of
    players, the complexity value would not be the same. Now, I know what
    you're thinking. Of course, complexity would change. The more advanced
    players would find cards less complex because they have a better grasp
    of the game fundamentals.</p>

  <p>That was expected. What was less expected was the discovery of the
    following phenomenon: Some cards were more complex to advanced players
    and less complex to beginners. What? How is that possible? The key is
    that some complexity is hidden, because it requires certain knowledge to
    even be aware of it. It turns out that some cards appear on their
    surface to be very simple, but once you understand more about how to use
    them, they become more complex.</p>

  <p>I dubbed these cards&mdash;ones where they were simple to the beginner but
    more advanced to the experienced player&mdash;lenticular cards. The term comes
    from a technique, sometimes used on trading cards, where multiple
    images are stuck on a card with a system that allows you to see
    different pictures as you tilt the card.</p>

  <p><img src="Lenticular%20Design_files/lenticularkitty.png"></p>

  <p>The example I first used when <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/188">I
      introduced the concept of lenticular cards</a> to all of you was <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Black+Cat">Black Cat</a>.
    To a beginner, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Black+Cat">Black
      Cat</a>
    is a two-mana 1/1 creature that has a nice surprise when it dies (the
    opponent discards a card). To the experienced player, though, the card
    is all about the death trigger. The threat of the death trigger
    influences how the card is played, something the beginner is oblivious
    to as he or she doesn't yet think about causality of play decisions.
    (I'll get to this in a minute.)</p>

  <p>So that is what a lenticular card is. This leads us to the next
    issue, which is how do we identify what elements cannot be seen by
    beginners?</p>

  <h2>The Complex Games</h2>

  <p>To understand this, we must first identify where the complexity lies in the game. As I have explained
    before, I believe <b>Magic</b> has three different types of complexity:</p>

  <h3>Comprehension Complexity</h3>

  <p>This first type of complexity has to do with understanding what a
    card does. Put simply, can you comprehend the function of the card once
    you've read it? What does it do? There are a bunch of different ways
    comprehension complexity can rear its ugly head.</p>

  <p>First, a card can use vocabulary that's not understood. A good example here is <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grip+of+Chaos"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Grip+of+Chaos">Grip
      of Chaos</a> from <i>Scourge</i>:</p>

  <p><img alt="Grip of Chaos" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image.jpg"></p>

  <p>While advanced players are well aware of the stack, it's not a concept that the majority of <b>Magic</b>
    players clearly understand. The reason we tend avoid using the term in
    rules text any more is because our testing showed that it continually
    confused players. I often talk about how we have to be careful with how
    much vocabulary the game uses because it's one of the biggest barriers
    to entry. When language gets in the way, it can make a card very hard to
    comprehend. (This is, by the way, why we began using reminder text on
    basic creature keywords in core sets.)</p>

  <p>Second, it can have text that is hard to process. <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Ringers"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Dead+Ringers">Dead
      Ringers</a> from <i>Apocalypse</i> is a perfect example:</p>

  <p><img alt="Dead Ringers" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_003.jpg"></p>

  <p>What does <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Ringers" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Dead+Ringers">Dead
      Ringers</a> do, exactly? If you have two creatures in play, one white-blue and one blue-red, and I cast
    <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Ringers" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Dead+Ringers">Dead
      Ringers</a>,
    will it destroy them both? The easiest way to identify this type of
    complexity is to see how many times a player has to read something to
    understand it. If the answer is more than once, the card has some
    comprehension complexity issues.</p>

  <p>Third, the text can require too many things to process. A classic example of this problem was the
    suspend mechanic from <i>Time Spiral</i>.</p>

  <p><img alt="Rift Bolt" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_009.jpg"></p>

  <p>Suspend had multiple costs, dealt with another zone, required the
    tracking of counters, and took place over many turns. All of it added up
    to create something that overwhelmed many less-experienced players.</p>

  <p>Fourth, the text can be perfectly clear but because the card seems to
    be doing something you would never want to do, some players will be
    confused. The classic example of this is the card <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=One+with+Nothing">One
      with Nothing</a> from <i>Saviors of Kamigawa</i>:</p>

  <p><img alt="One with Nothing" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_007.jpg"></p>

  <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=One+with+Nothing">One
      with Nothing</a>
    has but three words of rules text, yet baffles a lot of players. Why?
    Because it's instructing players to do something they don't understand
    why they would want to do. What happens is that players read the text
    and because they don't understand how it would be used, they assume they
    are misunderstanding something and thus convince themselves they don't
    understand it even though they comprehend the words.</p>

  <p>In each case, the less-experienced player reads the rules text and is
    stopped because he or she cannot grasp what he or she is supposed to do
    with the card.</p>

  <h3>Board Complexity</h3>

  <p>This type of complexity is about how the cards interact with one
    another once they are on the battlefield. It's not that each card is
    hard to understand in isolation, the comprehension complexity on them
    often is low, but rather it's hard to understand how they all interact
    together. The classic example of this was <i>Lorwyn</i> and <i>Morningtide</i>,
    where the cards created this elaborate interconnectivity that made it
    hard for players to figure out what was possible on the board. It was
    very common for less-experienced players to walk into "on the board"
    tricks because they simply weren't able to track all of the possible
    connections between the cards.</p>

  <p>Board complexity tends to boil down to several categories:</p>

  <p>First is the subset of cards that affect other permanents on the
    battlefield. A classic example of this type of board complexity card
    that many players don't think of as being complex is <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Prodigal+Pyromancer">Prodigal
      Pyromancer</a> (and his predecessor, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Sorcerer"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Prodigal+Sorcerer">Prodigal
      Sorcerer</a>)</p>

  <p><img alt="Prodigal Pyromancer" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_005.jpg"></p>

  <p>The reason <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Prodigal+Pyromancer">Prodigal
      Pyromancer</a>
    creates board complexity is because in combat he has the potential to
    change the math of any fight. Because players don't know where he'll be
    used, they have to take in account each and every case he <i>may</i> be
    used, which makes the math significantly harder. For advanced players,
    who have learned how to shorthand the combat, adding in the additional
    factor is much easier and, thus, to many, doesn't seem like a big deal.
    (It happens to be a big enough deal that we no longer do the card at
    common. There's more reasons than just that one, but that reason alone
    is probably enough for the shift.)</p>

  <p>Second is the subset of cards that are affected by other permanents on the battlefield. An example of
    this type of card is <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfaring+Temple"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Wayfaring+Temple">Wayfaring
      Temple</a> from <i>Return to Ravnica</i>.</p>

  <p><img alt="Wayfaring Temple" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_002.jpg"></p>

  <p>This type of card can be hard to track because it requires you to
    always be aware of other cards on the battlefield. For instance,
    attacking with <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfaring+Temple" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Wayfaring+Temple">Wayfaring
      Temple</a> can get complicated when you attack with other creatures and have to factor in the <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfaring+Temple"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Wayfaring+Temple">Wayfaring
      Temple</a>'s power and toughness after combat has happened.</p>

  <p>This type of complexity seems benign on the surface, because each
    card in isolation can often seem harmless enough, but as the battlefield
    fills with more and more of them they can quickly become very hard to
    track.</p>

  <h3>Strategic Complexity</h3>

  <p>This last category is about how the cards are maximized through proper play. <b>Magic</b>
    is a game with a lot of decisions. Some cards are complex not because
    they are hard to understand or complex in combination but simply because
    they offer the player so many options. As an example, let's look at <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Fact+or+Fiction">Fact
      or Fiction</a>, originally from <i>Invasion</i>:</p>

  <p><img alt="Fact or Fiction" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_006.jpg"></p>

  <p>This card is very powerful, but only in the hands of a player who
    knows how to correctly use it. Not only do you have to properly split
    the cards, but you have to be able to both judge the environment and
    your opponent to make sure you are valuing each card correctly.</p>

  <p>This category is the broadest, in that there are many different ways
    for cards to be strategically complex. In addition, cards change values
    based on which formats they are played in, meaning that a card might be
    strategically complex in one format and less so in another.</p>

  <p>I bring up these three types of complexities because they will become
    very important in a second as I start explaining the basic rules we've
    learned about lenticular design.</p>

  <h2>The Basic Rules of Lenticular Design</h2>

  <p>With the setup out of the way, let's start talking details. Here is what we've learned so far about
    lenticular design.</p>

  <p>A quick aside. I am going to start talking about what beginners do
    and don't see. This is not me belittling newer players. The motive
    behind lenticular design is that we want to find ways to add complexity
    to enhance the game for the more-experienced players without increasing
    the difficulty for the less-experienced ones. We very much value newer
    players. Our attention to lenticular design is us trying to make both
    ends of the spectrum happy at the same time.</p>

  <h3>Rule #1&mdash;Some Complexities are Invisible to Inexperienced Players</h3>

  <p>When trying to understand what matters to less-experienced players, the following appears to be true:</p>

  <p><b>Comprehension Complexity &rarr; Board Complexity &rarr; Strategic Complexity</b></p>



  <p>Novice players notice comprehension complexity immediately, because
    their main goal is making sure they understand what their cards do.
    Board complexity is invisible at first but it doesn't take too long for
    them to start looking at card interactions. The real ghost of
    complexities for less-experienced players is strategic complexity.
    Because it requires a lot of knowledge to understand context, strategic
    complexity can take players quite a while to start seeing.</p>

  <p>Lenticular design uses this to great advantage. If you can keep your
    card low in comprehension and board complexity, you can sneak in quite a
    bit of strategic complexity. The key is understanding how exactly to do
    this.</p>

  <h3>Rule #2&mdash;Cards Have to Have a Surface Value</h3>

  <p>To sneak in strategic complexity you need to understand this rule.
    When newer players read cards, they need to feel they understand what
    they do. Once they do, they move their attention to the next card. This
    means that, when designing a lenticular card, you have to make sure it
    has a surface value&mdash;it has to appear to do something.</p>

  <p>The corollary to this rule is that the card cannot have any text that
    does something the player cannot understand. If there is a sentence
    that doesn't fit the surface value of what the card does, it will pull
    the player's focus and he or she will spend time and energy trying to
    understand it, and the card stops being lenticular.</p>

  <p>This doesn't mean that you can't have relevant strategic text, it
    just has to make sense to the novice player. Note that a lot of
    lenticular design comes from the fact that the player understands what
    the card does, functionally, but doesn't see the strategic ramifications
    of that ability.</p>

  <h3>Rule #3&mdash;Experience Is Connected to How Far Ahead a Player Thinks</h3>

  <p>How are you able to have relevant strategic text right in front of
    the new players' eyes without them realizing what it is? The key is
    understanding the blind spots of a newer player. The first blind spot is
    time. As players become more and more experienced, they learn to think
    further ahead. In fact, one of the thing that always blows me away about
    the best players is how they will make plays that seem nonsensical, and
    only many turns later do you understand why they did it.</p>

  <p>Beginners are very focused because they are trying to learn the
    basics. As such, they don't think very far ahead. At first, their focus
    is on the moment, trying to figure out what they need to do right now.
    What card can they cast? What part of the turn is it? What life are they
    and their opponent at? With time, they start to think a little more
    ahead. They begin to plan out their entire turn.</p>

  <p>But it's not for a while before they start to think about more
    advanced concepts such as, "I can play this card right now, but is there
    a reason I might want to wait to cast it later?" It is in this space
    that lenticular design tends to thrive.</p>

  <h3>Rule #4&mdash;Novices Tend Not to Think of Causality</h3>

  <p>The best way to explain this rule is with an example. One of the
    things I will do is watch newer players play to see what they are
    focusing on. It is through this observation that I learned an
    interesting thing about death triggers (a death trigger is a triggered
    ability that happens when a creature dies). Less-experienced players
    will play a creature with a death trigger and then just play it as if it
    was a vanilla creature, ignoring the death trigger. Then, when it dies,
    they treat the death trigger as a free surprise gift.</p>

  <p>What they don't do is make decisions with the creature using the
    knowledge of the death trigger to determine how to use it. Let's take
    the following card, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Festering+Goblin">Festering
      Goblin</a>, originally from <i>Onslaught</i>:</p>

  <p><img alt="Festering Goblin" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_004.jpg"></p>

  <p>An experienced player will make attacking and blocking decisions
    based on the death trigger. For instance, he or she might use a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Festering+Goblin">Festering
      Goblin</a> to block a 2-toughness creature because the experienced player knows the combat damage from
    the <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Festering+Goblin">Festering
      Goblin</a>
    plus the -1/-1 effect will kill it. The beginning player, though,
    doesn't tend to think of the death trigger as a result of blocking, so
    the idea that you could combine the creature damage with the death
    trigger effect never occurs to him or her.</p>

  <p>This means that a helpful way to create lenticular cards is to add
    abilities that appear on the surface to be fluff. Often, this is done by
    making them flavorful. As long as they have an apparent purpose, the
    beginners will treat them as a bonus. But you have to be careful, which
    leads us to our next rule.</p>

  <h3>Rule #5&mdash;Players Will Try to Use the Cards to Match Their Perceived Function</h3>

  <p>To explain this rule, let me show you two cards:</p>

  <p><img alt="Venerable Monk" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/venerablemonk.png"> <img alt="Aven Cloudchaser" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/avencloudchaser.jpg"></p>

  <p>Both of these cards are 2/2 white creatures from <i>Tenth Edition</i>
    with "enter the battlefield" triggers that sometimes saw play in
    Limited. One is a good lenticular card while the other is not. <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Monk"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Venerable+Monk">Venerable
      Monk</a>
    gives you life. The beginning player tends to over-value life, so he or
    she is quite happy to play it. While the more-experienced player will
    play <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Monk" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Venerable+Monk">Venerable
      Monk</a> early (or late, if it's relevant to the board), he or she will sometimes choose to keep it in
    hand if drawn later in the game.</p>

  <p>The reason is that the late game is all about "the clock." That is,
    players are making decisions based on how many turns it will take before
    they or their opponents are dead. Because the clock becomes so
    important, lifegain takes on a new role later in the game and players
    tend to withhold the information that they have the ability to impact it
    until the last possible moment, to try and get their opponents to act
    on false information.</p>

  <p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser" data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Aven+Cloudchaser">Aven
      Cloudchaser</a>,
    on the other hand, has a function that requires your opponent having
    something&mdash;an enchantment. The beginner recognizes the value of the
    ability, and thus waits for it to be useful, meaning he or she will hold
    the 2/2 flier in his or her hand until its "enter the battlefield"
    ability can be used. The experienced player will often recognize that
    the need for the 2/2 flier outweighs the enchantment destruction.</p>

  <p>So why isn't this a good lenticular card? The beginner and the
    veteran play the card differently. Isn't that the point? No, because the
    card creates a bad experience for the beginner. By leaving the 2/2
    flier in his or her hand, the beginner will become frustrated because he
    or she wants the flier but feels obligated to wait. The goal of a good
    lenticular card is to make a good game for players from both ends of the
    spectrum.</p>

  <p>As such, it is important to remember that a good lenticular card has
    to encourage the proper behavior for each type of player. For beginners,
    it wants to encourage the player to use it. Beginners want action and
    want to feel like the game is moving forward. Also, you want to give
    them the tools to help push the game toward a conclusion. Getting
    creatures onto the battlefield is a start. For experienced players, in
    contrast, lenticular cards want to have strategic depth, most often
    meaning the cards will have different uses based on the state of the
    game.</p>

  <h3>Rule #6&mdash;Let the Players Play the Game They Want to Play</h3>

  <p>This last point is the final rule for today. The key to good game
    design is creating a game that maximizes the players doing what they
    want to do. Remember that it's the job of the designer to make the game
    head toward a state that will cause it to conclude. For beginners, that
    means you want them to cast as many cards as possible and have things
    happen that they understand and enjoy.</p>

  <p>For advanced players, you are trying to give them the tools to win,
    but you do not need to be nearly as blunt. In fact, the more experienced
    players want to feel as if the designer is giving them the resources to
    create their own experience. They don't want to feel led down a path,
    but rather, given a giant map to explore.</p>

  <p>The trick to lenticular cards is making cards that fill both roles.
    Make cards that don't get in the way of the beginner playing them but
    enable the advanced player to have options. Most death triggers fill
    this role. Enter-the-battlefield triggers that don't dictate action tend
    to fill this role. Certain activated abilities can fill this role.</p>

  <p>You don't have to stop with creatures. Noncreature spells can be
    lenticular by having an obvious surface use but also having secondary
    uses that can be valuable.</p>

  <p><img alt="Rescue from the Underworld" src="Lenticular%20Design_files/Image_008.jpg"></p>

  <p>For example, to a beginner, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rescue+from+the+Underworld"
      data-image-url="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Rescue+from+the+Underworld">Rescue
      from the Underworld</a> from <i>Theros</i>
    has a specific purpose. It very flavorfully reanimates a creature, but
    to a more-experienced player, it does more than that. For instance, it
    indirectly flickers a creature. There are many ways in <i>Theros</i>
    Limited to make good use of that ability. It is by hiding extra
    functionality in a flavorful card that the designer can work in
    lenticular cards into the design.</p>

  <h3>Two Ways To Look At It</h3>

  <p>Often, when I talk about making the game more accessible to beginning
    players, the focus is on simplification. Today's article is trying to
    demonstrate that it's much more complicated than that. Sometimes, it's
    not about removing the complexity, but hiding it. Sometimes, it's about
    finding a way to create a simple card to allow options for those looking
    to find them. Sometimes, it's viewing each card through various lenses
    to see how different players will perceive it.</p>

  <p>The concept of lenticular cards is a complex one and it is still
    something we keep working to better understand. I hope with today's
    article to give you a little better sense of what kinds of things we
    think about and where we look to sneak in extra bits for the
    more-experienced player.</p>
