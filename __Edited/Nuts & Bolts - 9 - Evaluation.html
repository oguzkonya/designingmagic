	<h1>Nuts &amp; Bolts: Evaluation</h1>

	<p>You've
		made your design skeleton, filled it in, playtested it, iterated it,
		evolved it, troubleshot it. Now we've gotten to the point where we need
		to put our pencils down, step back from the set, and evaluate it with a
		fresh eye.</p>

	<p>One of the most difficult things to do as a designer is learning to
		see your own work with an unbiased eye. Along the way, you've gotten
		close to the project. You've made so many decisions and have spent giant
		amounts of time thinking about it. It's hard to distance yourself from
		the emotional bond you've formed with your set, but part of designing is
		being able to answer some tough questions&mdash;and that means you have to
		get to a point where you can recognize ugly attributes of your baby.</p>

	<p>The first trick is to get a little bit of distance. Before an
		evaluation, I like to give myself some time away from the set. I let my
		brain move off it and onto something else so that when I come back to
		look at it, I have a fresher perspective. One of the best times to do a
		review is after a vacation or following a period of time highly focusing
		on another task.</p>

	<p>The second trick is to ask a series of questions so that you're
		focused on answering the questions rather than trying to subjectively
		judge your set. Today I will be walking you through the seven major
		questions I ask myself when I'm evaluating one of my own sets.</p>

	<p>The third trick is internalizing the idea that by being harsh, by
		asking tough questions of your set, that you are helping to make it
		better. There's a time where you need to dote on your set and give it
		all the love and attention you can, but there's also a time where you
		need to be able to step back and look objectively to make sure that you
		haven't drifted, that intimacy with your set hasn't made you blind to
		changes that have happened.</p>

	<p>The fourth trick is not doing this alone. If you are working with a
		team, this is something all of you can be involved in. If you're working
		by yourself, pull in someone you trust who can give you their take on
		these questions. Having other opinions to bounce off of makes this
		process much easier.</p>

	<p>With all that said, let's get onto the seven questions.</p>

	<h3>Question #1: Does Your Set Have a Unified Vision? (Is It About Something?)</h3>

	<p>You have up to seven words. Describe your set. Can you do it?</p>

	<p><em>Kaladesh</em>: Feel like an optimistic aetherpunk inventor</p>

	<p><em>Shadows of Innistrad</em>: Insanity engulfs a Gothic horror plane</p>

	<p><em>Battle for Zendikar</em>: Stop the alien Eldrazi from destroying Zendikar</p>

	<p>The first question asks if you've created a bunch of individual cards or a cohesive set. A <em>Magic </em>set
		is not a random selection of cards thrown together; it's a carefully
		crafted experience. All the components of your set have to be working
		together to tell one consistent story. I don't mean the literal story
		(although that can help) but rather what the player is doing when they
		encounter your mechanics and cards. What experience do you mean for them
		to have? What does it mean to play your set?</p>

	<p>One of the biggest problems I see with novice designs is that there's
		a lack of focus. The designer collects a bunch of different things that
		they like in isolation and then puts them together. A set requires more
		than just "enough cards." It requires that all the cards work together
		to create something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

	<p>The metaphor I'll use for this question is to think of your set like a
		recipe. You don't make a good recipe by just throwing together various
		tasty flavors. A good recipe is finding a group of ingredients that
		taste good in conjunction with one another. No one eats a cookie and
		compliments you on the butter or the flour. They compliment you on the
		cookie.</p>

	<p>Your set is no different than the cookie. You don't want your
		audience focused on what's in the cookie; you want them focused on how
		great the cookie, as a single unified thing, is. Success at set design
		is not the audience liking a piece of it, but rather them enjoying the
		entirety of what your set is doing.</p>

	<p>The reason I ask this first is because if you don't pass this test,
		nothing else is going to matter. If your set, at its core, isn't about
		something, it's never going to satisfy the questions that come next. And
		be aware that it's possible that when your set started, it was about
		something, but as you made changes to make it work mechanically, it may
		have lost that focus.</p>

	<h3>Question #2: Does Everything in Your Set Serve That Unified Vision?</h3>

	<p>Once it's clear your set is about one specific vision, the next
		question is whether all the various pieces tie into that vision. That's
		not to say your set can't have numerous functions, but does each serve
		the larger goal? <em>Kaladesh</em>, for instance, was an aetherpunk
		world that made the players feel like inventors. Different parts of the
		set captured different aspects of that vision. Some of the set was
		creating the atmosphere of the world, some building the structure that
		allowed different pieces to be clicked together, some working to make
		the mechanics interact and the gameplay flow smoothly. Your set gets to
		have lots of different elements. This question asks if everything in the
		set is working in the same direction toward your vision.</p>

	<p>Another common mistake of novice designs is to include things not
		because they serve the set, but because you like them in a vacuum. It's
		such a cool card, who cares if it doesn't fit in with what the set's
		doing? The answer is <em>you</em> have to care because in a trading card
		game, you don't control the order in which your audience is going to
		see your set. Any card could be the introduction. And every card has the
		potential to play with each other card in your set, so any card in your
		set could shape how the other cards are viewed.</p>



	<p>For this question, I'll use a movie metaphor. Pick your favorite
		humorous movie scene of all time. The one that just makes you laugh <em>every </em>time you see it. I'm going to
		take that scene and put it in a different movie of my choosing. That movie is going to be <em>Schindler's List</em>,
		an Academy Awardâ€“winning film about one man's mission to save Jewish
		lives during the Holocaust. If you've never seen it, it's an emotional,
		gut-wrenching drama. What would adding your comedic movie scene do to
		the film? It would feel grossly out of place and probably be a lot less
		funny, possibly even offensive. Context matters. Things are not judged
		in isolation, but through their relationship with everything around
		them.</p>

	<p>That card that's just so awesome in a vacuum might be horribly unfun
		in the context of your set. Or it might lead players to create
		expectations that your set is never going to deliver on. A player
		drafting your set might be getting signals that aren't true. A<em> Magic</em>
		set is judged by its interactions, which means that every component of
		your set has to be working in the same direction. This question forces
		you to look at every card and ask yourself, "Is my set better because
		this card is here?" If the answer to any card is no, the card has to
		change.</p>

	<h3>Question #3: Do the Pieces Work Together?</h3>

	<p>Every element of your set follows your unified vision. That means
		that all of it should work together wonderfully. Uh, no. There are many
		ways to follow a theme, and some of the ways can contradict. I'll give
		an example. I've decided to make Mons happy by making a set I'll call <em>Goblin Explosion. Goblin Explosion
		</em>is
		a tribal set dedicated to Goblins. Every creature in it is a Goblin
		(Goblin Dwarves, Goblin Merfolk, Goblin Zombies, Goblin Elves, you name
		it). Every non-creature spell references Goblins in some way.</p>

	<p>Let's imagine I decided to make a bunch of the creatures have static
		abilities that grant things to Goblins. "All Goblins gain Haste and
		Menace." That kind of thing. Then also imagine I made a mechanic for
		instants and sorceries that allowed you to fork the spell if you
		sacrifice a Goblin. Each of those pieces is in theme, but they don't
		necessarily work with one another. The static abilities want there to be
		a lot of Goblins on the battlefield. The spell mechanic wants you to
		sacrifice Goblins. Those two things don't normally go together.</p>

	<p>This question is asking whether the different elements are working in
		conjunction with one another. Another novice mistake is overvaluing
		tension. "Oh, you'll have difficult decisions to make, that'll make
		things fun." Most often, that isn't true. The best sets give clear
		messages of what the players are supposed to want. The fun comes in
		figuring out how to achieve those goals in the most efficient and
		powerful way, not in trying to figure out what the goal is supposed to
		be.</p>

	<p>To use a real-life example, in early <em>Scars of Mirrodin</em>, we
		messed around with having cards that rewarded you for being poisoned.
		Wouldn't it be cool if sometimes it was beneficial to have poison
		counters? What ended up happening though was players weren't sure if
		they were supposed to attack or not with poison creatures, and if they
		were wrong, they felt as if they'd made a mistake even if there was no
		information at the time to tell them which was the right call. We took
		that stuff out and players had a lot better time because they then knew
		what to do with their poison creatures&mdash;attack!</p>

	<p>When fleshing out your theme, it's fine to examine a lot of different
		avenues to figure out what you like best. But at some point, you have
		to pick your direction and then focus on that. This question makes sure
		that you've picked a direction within your vision so that various parts
		of your design aren't working at odds with one another.</p>

	<h3>Question 4: Is It Fun to Play?</h3>

	<p>Your set is about something. All of it. And the pieces are working in
		conjunction rather than at odds with one another. The next question is a
		very basic one: is the set enjoyable to play?</p>

	<p>This might seem like a silly question, but it's actually quite a
		serious one. A common mistake I see with novice designs is they get so
		focused on all the minutiae of trying to make the set work, they take
		their eye off the big picture. A game, or in this case a set, lives or
		dies on one basic element: do people want to play it? Is the act of
		doing what your set is asking the players to do fun?</p>

	<p>Of all the questions I'm asking of you, this one is the easiest to
		get blind to because the act of making something, of dwelling weeks upon
		weeks and months upon months on the same designs, dulls you to the
		connection between the designer, the player, and the cards. It's similar
		to what happens to a film editor after they've watched the same scene
		hundreds of times. It becomes difficult to form an untainted opinion
		when you're so intimately involved with the thing in question.</p>

	<p>This is partly why you have playtests and involve other people. It's
		important though to get a little distance personally so that you can
		reapproach your own design. Part of leading something is being the one
		to sign off on what your design has become. You have to be able to pull
		back and see the forest for the trees. This requires playing with your
		set and being honest with yourself about whether you enjoy what's being
		asked of you as a player.</p>

	<p>The interesting thing about this process is that when you change your
		vantage point, when you get your head out of the details, you'll at
		times find a clarity that you didn't previously have. I often discover
		during evaluation time that I can start to think of my design in a
		different way, which allows me the freedom to analyze it in a new light
		and start to see if I drifted to a place that isn't living up to the
		vision's potential.</p>

	<p>Note that this question isn't asking you to evaluate all the
		components, but rather check in on whether not the larger focus you've
		chosen is inherently going to lead to a fun <em>Magic</em> set.</p>

<h3>Question 5: Is There Depth? (Is There Room for Discovery?)</h3>

	<p>This next question wants to evaluate your set on a different vector,
		so let me talk about something I call layering. This is a writing
		technique I learned from my favorite college writing professor. One day
		she said to us, "Whenever you write, you want to make sure that each
		time someone reads your work, they're getting something different out of
		it&mdash;that the first reading is a different experience than the second,
		which is a different experience from the third, and so on."</p>

	<p>A lot of us liked the idea, but didn't understand how you would do that. She used as an example a famous
		Japanese movie called <em>Rashomon</em>.
		While most of you have probably not seen the original movie, the type
		of story it created has become a staple of modern story telling. A
		"Rashomon" story is one where you keep hearing parts of it from
		different people's perspective, and with new perspectives you start to
		reevaluate previous information you had.</p>



	<p>My professor explained that each reading of your story should allow
		the reader to have new perspective such that, like a "Rashomon" story,
		the reader reevaluates what they already know. Just think about any
		story where there was a twist. On the second reading, you know the twist
		and can start seeing where the author began setting it up, dropping
		clues that you previously missed.</p>

	<p>Layering is when you stick things in your story that will not be
		fully understood without information gathered elsewhere, usually
		occurring later in the story. For a trading card game, layering is
		adding in things players can learn, but not until they understand other
		aspects of the set. The idea is you build in parts of your gameplay that
		have to be "unlocked" in a video game sense. A good example of this in <em>Magic</em>
		is adding in synergies that might not be obvious at first glance. It's
		not until the player happens to have a card from each part that they
		learn they can be combined. The player will then start looking for new
		ways to combine these effects, which allows them to discover other new
		things that have been layered in.</p>

	<p>This question is basically asking if you've made sure that your set
		has things players will discover as more and more parts of your set
		begin interacting.</p>

<h3>Question #6: Have You Added Something New? (Is There Something to Surprise Your Audience?)</h3>

	<p>The very first thing players ask when a set is previewed is "What's
		new?" Now I believe innovation can be overvalued in design, but you
		always need to have some. Part of the experience of playing a new <em>Magic </em>set
		is viewing the game through a slightly different lens than you're used
		to seeing it. I often explain how I know a set has an identity when I
		find myself caring about some aspect of gameplay I don't normally care
		about (land drops in<em> Zendikar </em>is a famous example).</p>

	<p>It's common in <em>Magic </em>design to start in a brand-new place
		and begin creeping closer and closer to the way things normally operate
		as we evolve the set. I can't count the number of times we have created a
		brand-new mechanic and then, as we playtest and iterate it, seen the
		mechanic start turning into one that already exists.<em> Magic</em>
		turns 24 years old this year, which means we've tread a lot of ground.
		It's important to look at your set and make sure that you're actually
		doing something new, rather than just redressing something the players
		have seen before. (By the way, I'm not against redressing old things to
		match the new flavor of the set; just don't put too much weight of
		innovation on it.)</p>

<h3>Question 7: Does It Feel Like Magic? (Will Players Have Things They Could Add to Their Already Existing Decks?)</h3>

	<p>This question is the opposite end of the spectrum from the previous
		question. Yes, you want each set to have some new elements to it, but
		you also want it to have enough familiarity that it's still the game
		players know and love. It's possible to create a <em>Magic</em> set that technically works in the rules, but
		that doesn't feel like <em>Magic</em>.
		The goal in any design is to create something that adds to the overall
		experience, not distances itself from everything that came before.</p>

	<p>The biggest issue here is what R&amp;D refers to as parasitism. That
		is, have you made things within your set that plays nicely with one
		other but don't connect with the rest of <em>Magic</em>? You do want
		some parasitism. It's nice if your set has new themes that require you
		to look within it, but you want to make sure those themes still allow
		intermixing with other sets.</p>

	<p>This final question is trying to make sure that you've reached a good
		balance. You want your set to work with itself, but not to the
		exclusion of working with other sets. You want your set to feel fresh
		and new, but not so much that it doesn't feel like <em>Magic</em>. You
		want your set to have an identity, but one that feels part of the larger
		identity of the game. You've done everything that your set is supposed
		to do; let's just double-check that you've made a <em>Magic </em>set.</p>

<h3>Seven Up</h3>

	<p>And those, my fellow designers, are the seven questions to ask when
		you evaluate your nearly complete set. The key with each of these questions is allowing
		yourself the ability to be brutally honest. Good design requires
		emotionally bonding to the thing you're creating, so taking the time to
		step back and critically evaluate your set is a hard thing to do&mdash;a <em>very</em>
		hard thing to do&mdash;but a critical one. This is the last big gauntlet
		before your set starts the final process of completion. Take the time
		and energy to do it right.</p>
