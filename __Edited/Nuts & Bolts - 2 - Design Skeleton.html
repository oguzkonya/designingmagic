  <h1>Nuts &amp; Bolts: Design Skeleton</h1>

  <p>Let's begin by answering the first question: what
    exactly is a design skeleton? The simplest metaphor I can think of is a
    blueprint. Before builders can come in and build a house, the architect
    has to map out what exactly he wants in the house. A design skeleton is a
    preliminary blueprint that helps the designer map out what he or she
    needs to have in the set. Today, I am going to build a design skeleton
    for an imaginary small set to show you how it is done. I am going to
    call my small set <i>Justice</i> as it is part of the <i>Truth</i>, <i>Justice,</i> and <i>The American
      Way</i>
    block (note&mdash;not actually a block, I'm making this up). Also, to keep
    things simple, I am just going to make the design skeleton for the
    common cards in the set. In a real design, the uncommons, rares, and
    mythic rares would also be added.</p>

  <p>A key part of design skeletons are card codes. Let's begin by
    laying down the card codes for <i>Justice</i>'s commons. I'm going to assume <i>Justice </i>has a common
    cycle of lands and five common artifacts. With this info, here's how the card codes lay out:</p>

  <p>The first thing we need to do is to figure out how many creatures we
    want. To do this we need to walk through what we know about the set:</p>

  <h3>#1 &mdash; The Set Is Going To Have Around 50% Creatures</h3>

  <p>The percentage of creatures tends to ebb and flow. R&amp;D's current
    philosophy is that Limited is more fun if you more often have to stretch
    a little bit for your last few cards rather than cut cards that you
    know are strong. At its core, <b>Magic</b> is about discovery so we've
    brought that philosophy to Limited where we want to force players to
    have to try out cards they might not have played before. Anyway, this
    means that of the 60 commons, only 30 are going to be creatures.</p>

  <h3>#2 &mdash; Colors Follow Their Normal Creature Distribution</h3>

  <p>As a default, here is what colors have the greatest percentage of creatures from most to least:</p>

  <p><b>White &mdash;</b> For a long time, green was the color that got the most
    creatures but a year or so back we spent some time trying to
    differentiate between white and green and came to the realization that
    it was silly for green to be the color that got the most <i>and</i> the
    biggest creatures at common. White is the "army color" so we decided it
    would make sense for white to get the largest number of creatures and
    leave green the largest creatures at common. White beats you with
    numbers while green beats you with size.</p>

  <p><b>Green &mdash;</b> While green isn't #1 anymore, it still is the "creature color" and thus gets the #2 slot.</p>

  <p><b>Black &mdash;</b> Black has become the color that tends to balance creatures and spells and thus sits in
    the middle.</p>

  <p><b>Red &mdash;</b> Blue and red are the two spell colors, meaning that they
    tend to have the most spells of the five colors. Red, though, has more
    creature needs than blue and thus is #4.</p>

  <p><b>Blue &mdash;</b> Some color has to have the fewest creatures. Why not the color most tied to spells?</p>

  <p><b>Artifacts &mdash;</b> From time to time a theme may bring artifacts from
    the bottom higher up (in artifact-themed blocks, it's often #1) but
    most of the time it only has zero to two artifact creatures at common.</p>

  <p>To figure out what each color gets, let's do the math. We have thirty
    slots and we want the colors to go in the order we set. With 30
    creatures, that averages out to 6 per color. Black is the average color
    so lets start by giving it 6. Now let's go up and down one for green and
    red respectively giving green 7 creatures and red 5. Then let's go up
    and down one more for white and blue giving white 8 and blue 4. Now we
    have to figure out whether or not we want an artifact creature. I'd like
    to have one but to do so means stealing one from a color. I'll steal
    one from white but to keep white up, I'm going to add a token making
    instant/sorcery to white. This is my way of staying at 50% while giving
    white a little something to keep it the "army-making" color.</p>

  <p>Here's what this all looks like in the skeleton: (remember that R&amp;D likes to put creatures first in
    the card codes)</p>

  <p>Just knowing they are creatures isn't enough. Next we want to figure
    two things. First, I like to make sure that we keep an eye out for the
    evergreen creature keywords. Second, the lead designer needs a sense of
    how big they are. For the skeleton, we tend to use three sizes: small,
    medium and large. Small means anything from a 0/1 up to about a 2/3.
    Medium is a 3/3 up to about a 4/5. Large is 5/5 or larger. Let's look at
    each color:</p>

  <h3>White</h3>

  <p><b>Keywords &mdash;</b> White gets the following at common: flying, first strike, vigilance and sometimes
    flash, protection or lifelink.</p>

  <p><b>Size &mdash;</b> Almost all of white's creatures are small. For Limited
    purposes, we've started giving white more medium creatures. Still, the
    majority of white should be small.</p>

  <h3><b>Blue</b></h3>

  <p><b>Keywords &mdash;</b> Blue gets flying and shroud, and sometimes islandwalk or flash.</p>

  <p><b>Size &mdash;</b> Blue usually has all small creatures with one medium and sometimes one large. The large is
    usually a serpent-like thing.</p>

  <h3><b>Black</b></h3>

  <p><b>Keywords &mdash;</b> Black gets the following at common: flying, deathtouch, intimidate, and sometimes
    haste, lifelink, regeneration or swampwalk.</p>

  <p><b>Size &mdash;</b> Black gets a mix of small and medium creatures but never large (well, barring some quirky
    block theme).</p>

  <h3><b>Red</b></h3>

  <p><b>Keywords &mdash;</b> Red gets the following at common: haste, first strike, trample, and sometimes
    intimidate or mountainwalk. <a>Firebreathing</a> isn't technically a keyword, but it shows up in almost
    every set.</p>

  <p><b>Size &mdash;</b> Red, like black, has a mix of small and medium
    creatures. Every once in a while red will have a large creature but most
    often at the small end of the large spectrum.</p>

  <h3><b>Green</b></h3>

  <p><b>Keywords &mdash;</b> Green gets the following at common: trample,
    deathtouch, regeneration, and sometimes flash, forestwalk, reach,
    shroud, or vigilance.</p>

  <p><b>Size &mdash;</b> Green has a mix of small and medium creatures and always at least one large (sometimes
    two).</p>

  <p>Lets take all this information and put it into the mix. Note that I'm
    making rough estimations on what size certain keywords will go. The
    design is not locked down to what I put. If, for instance, I need to
    move vigilance from a medium creature to a small I can. Here's what the
    skeleton looks like now:</p>

  <pre> CW01 &mdash; creature, small 
 CW02 &mdash; creature, small, flying 
 CW03 &mdash; creature, small, first strike 
 CW04 &mdash; creature, small 
 CW05 &mdash; creature, small

 CL05 &mdash; </pre>



  <p>Now that the creatures are mapped out, let's turn our attention to the other card types.</p>

  <p><b>Artifacts &mdash;</b> Obviously, I already assigned five at common. Odds
    are these are going to be simple utility cards. Without Esper-like
    oddness, artifacts don't show up in colors.</p>

  <p><b>Enchantments &mdash;</b> As a general rule the only enchantments we tend
    to do at common are auras. Block themes can tweak that, but without a
    reason you will not see global enchantments (this is an old term but I
    don't know of one that's replaced it so I'm still using it) at common.
    Most colors will have at least one aura, with white and green sometimes
    having more than one.</p>

  <p><b>Instants &mdash;</b> All five colors get instants but white and blue tend to have more proportionally than
    the rest.</p>

  <p><b>Lands &mdash;</b> Like artifacts, lands have been assigned their own common slots and don't show up in
    colors.</p>

  <p><b>Planeswalkers &mdash;</b> For some odd reason we don't tend to do this card type at common.</p>

  <p><b>Sorceries &mdash;</b> All five colors get sorceries but black and green tend to have more proportionally
    than the rest.</p>

  <p><b>Tribal &mdash;</b> Tribal is the only card type that we don't use every
    block. I keep getting letters about how a specific spell wants to, based
    on flavor, have tribal. The answer is that we only use tribal when it
    is a major component in the block.</p>

  <p>Let's layer this in:</p>

  <pre> CW01 &mdash; creature, small 
 CW02 &mdash; creature, small, flying 
 CW03 &mdash; creature, small, first strike 
 CW04 &mdash; creature, small, flash 
 CW05 &mdash; creature, medium, vigilance

 CA03 &mdash; tap ability 
 CA04 &mdash; equipment 
 CA05 &mdash; equipment 
 CL01 &mdash; produces W 
 CL02 &mdash; produces U 
 CL03 &mdash; produces B 
 CL04 &mdash; produces R 
 CL05 &mdash; produces G</pre>



  <p>Notice how I made some changes to the skeleton as I was adding in new
    things. The best example is in white. I realized that I was a little
    tight so I did a few things. First, I removed a creature because it
    became clear that with ten slots pulled out for artifacts and land white
    couldn't hold eight creatures. As I wanted enough space for instants to
    give white the combat tricks it likes, I chose to make the token-making
    spell a sorcery. I then added flash to one of the white creatures
    because even with two instants I knew I needed to have a little more
    surprise for white.</p>

  <p>This demonstrates the point of the skeleton. The skeleton isn't there
    to lock the designer in but to make the designer aware of what things
    they need to allocate. When something isn't working, the designer then
    has to re-jigger the skeleton to get what they need.</p>

  <p>Notice also that I also made some determination of what kind of
    artifacts I wanted and pointed out that the land was a cycle by
    stressing the colors.</p>

  <p>Next, I have to weave in whatever the set is about. Let's suppose that the <i>Truth</i>, <i>Justice,</i>
    and <i>the American Way</i> block is about the graveyard. <i>Truth</i>
    created a graveyard-based mechanic (I'm calling it gravetwist; once
    again completely made up for this article) that went on permanents and
    spells. It's something that can be grafted onto any type of spell so I
    can pair it with different effects. To do this, while I'm weaving the
    block mechanic in, I'm also going to weave in what I call the basic
    effects. Let's run through these quickly. These are effects that pretty
    much show up in every set in common in a particular color:</p>

  <p><b>White &mdash;</b> White always has some kind of lifegain, enchantment removal, and creature removal (which
    can include <a>Pacifism</a>-like
    effects), and some combat trick (small power/toughness boosting and
    ability granting are common ones). It often has team boosting ("all your
    creatures get +1/+1" until end of turn) and damage
    prevention/redirection.</p>

  <p><b>Blue &mdash;</b> Blue always has a counterspell (often two, one hard,
    one soft), "bounce" ("return BLAH to its owner's hand"), card drawing,
    creature-control enchantment (most often locking it down), and sometimes
    has a card sifting, shrinking ("target creature gets &mdash;N/-0 until end of
    turn"), or twiddling ("tap or untap target BLAH").</p>

  <p><b>Black &mdash;</b> Black always has multiple creature kill (usually
    "destroy target nonBLAH creature" and "target creature gets &mdash;N/-N until
    end of turn"), discard, graveyard creature retrieval ("return a creature
    card from your graveyard to your hand"), and often has power boosting
    ("CARDNAME gets +N/+0 until end of turn), card drawing for life, or
    damage/life loss to a creature or player oftentimes where you gain life
    as a result.</p>

  <p><b>Red &mdash;</b> Red always has direct damage (on numerous spells, some
    hitting players, some creatures and some both), power boosting, panic
    effects ("target creature cannot block"), and sometimes haste granting
    and land destruction.</p>

  <p><b>Green &mdash;</b> Green always has power/toughness boosting, land
    searching, artifact/enchantment removal, and often mana production, life
    gain, fog ("prevent all combat damage"), and flying destruction.</p>

  <p>Note that whatever doesn't show up in common can show up in uncommon to still have a presence in
    Limited.</p>

  <p>With all this in mind, let's take another swipe at the skeleton:</p>

  <pre> CW01 &mdash; creature, small 
 CW02 &mdash; creature, small, flying, gravetwist

 CL03 &mdash; produces B 
 CL04 &mdash; produces R 
 CL05 &mdash; produces G</pre>



  <p>Putting in all the keywords starts to make me realize where I'm
    getting squeezed for effects. I can solve some of those problems by
    using creature slots. I can use an enter the battlefield (ETB) trigger,
    for example, to mimic a sorcery. The skeleton also forced me to start
    thinking about things like how much gravetwist do I want and in what
    colors? In addition, I get to start examining if it's flavored
    differently in different colors. Notice how it's heavier in black and
    green, the two graveyard colors. I also made white and green put the
    ability on creatures while blue and red used it only on instants and
    sorceries.</p>

  <p>How many passes a designer does on a particular skeleton has a lot to
    do with the needs of the individual set. What I have above might be
    enough or might require a few more passes if there are other issues that
    need to be addressed. What you can tell from just the sample skeleton
    that I have posted is that the most common design issue is having too
    much to fit in, rather than too little.</p>

  <p>It's important to remember that the skeleton is a flexible, living,
    breathing document. The reason you make it is to give you a sense of
    where things are in the moment. As cards start going in, you will begin
    to see where ideas you had won't work and that will force you to
    reconfigure the skeleton. In the end, the design skeleton is a tool that
    better allows the designers to get a big picture of all the moving
    parts to their set allowing them to start figuring out what their set is
    going to need design-wise.</p>
