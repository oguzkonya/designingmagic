  <h1>Seeing Red</h1>

  <h3>What Does Red Desire? What Is Its End Goal?</h3>

  <p>Red wants freedom.</p>

  <p>Everyone seems preoccupied with the meaning of life. Red's not,
    because red already knows the answer. You see, your heart tells you what
    it needs in order to be fulfilled. All you have to do is listen to it
    and act accordingly. It's not a mystery. You are literally bombarded
    with constant feelings that guide you down the correct path. The problem
    is all the other colors ignore the message.</p>

  <p>Life's an adventure, and it's up to each individual to experience it.
    The key is to embrace your emotions and let them guide you. If you're
    happy, laugh. If you're sad, cry. If you're angry, hit something. If
    you're scared, run away. Listen to your inner voice and you will have
    the opportunity to experience all that life has to offer.</p>

  <p>Too many individuals live their life questioning choices they've
    made. Not red. Red lives in the moment; red is spontaneous; red embraces
    every adventure put before it. Red knows that on its deathbed, it will
    look back on a fulfilled life with no regrets. That's all red wants&mdash;the
    ability to live life doing what it needs to.</p>

  <p>This doesn't mean red is alone. Quite the opposite actually. Part of
    living life is embracing relationships. Red knows passion and loyalty
    and camaraderie and lust. When red bonds with another, it bonds strongly
    and fiercely. Whether a lover or a friend, red is someone who will
    always be there when you need them. Well, unless, life has taken them
    somewhere else for some length of time&mdash;but then when they get back,
    they're definitely going to be there for you.</p>

  <p>To outsiders, red might seem a bit chaotic; but that's only because
    others can't see what's in red's heart. They cannot feel red's emotions
    guiding them. Living life to its fullest takes a lot of dedication and
    perseverance, but red is always up to the task.</p>


  <h3>What Means Does Red Use To Achieve These Ends?</h3>

  <p>Red is a color of action. If you want something, you have to
    constantly be taking steps towards your goal. You can't cross the finish
    line if you're not in the race. Red achieves its goals because it
    prioritizes making things happen and it takes the steps to ensure that
    they will.</p>

  <p>A big part of this is red being very attuned to its feelings. Red
    always knows the next action it has to take, because it listens to what
    its heart is instructing it to do. Red is never without direction or
    guidance. Now, that direction can change&mdash;sometimes quickly&mdash;because the
    heart is fickle, but red is always ready to act.</p>

  <p>Red has a few different tools at its disposal. First, it has the
    resources to be destructive when it needs to be. If something is causing
    red problems, red can blow it up. Or burn it down. Or destroy it
    through a variety of different means. Red's not afraid to get its hands
    dirty, and it never backs down from a challenge.</p>

  <p>Red also has speed on its side. Red's impulsiveness allows it to act
    instantaneously, and it doesn't ever need time to think through its
    actions. Red can hit fast and strong before others can even prepare for
    what's coming.</p>

  <p>Red is good at manipulating emotions. Just as red feels every impulse
    strongly, it can fan the flames of emotions within others&mdash;often to
    powerful effect.</p>

  <p>Red can be very tricky. It has an impish nature that it can tap into, which allows it to interfere with
    the plans of others.</p>

  <p>Red is relentless. As long as red cares about something, it will keep trying until it gets what it
    needs.</p>

  <p>Red's focus and energy make it the most driven color. It knows what
    it wants and it acts on those feelings without the slightest hesitation.
    Getting between red and what it wants can be very, very dangerous.</p>


  <h3>What Does Red Care About? What Does Red Represent?</h3>

  <p>Here are some things essential to red:</p>

  <p><strong>Emotion</strong>&mdash;If you're going to follow your heart, that
    means being in touch with your emotions. And not just some of your
    emotions, but all of them. <em>Magic</em> is a combat-oriented game, so
    we obviously focus more on anger and aggressive emotions that make sense
    in combat. But red is just as swayed by every emotion. Red also doesn't
    bottle up its emotions, it lets them out. Red loves action, and
    emotions are great motivators.</p>

  <p><strong>Mood Swings</strong>&mdash;Not only is red focused on emotions,
    it's always focused on many emotions all at once. This means that red is
    more prone than any other color to have emotional swings. Red can laugh
    one moment and be in tears the next. Others might see this as being
    unfocused and easily distracted, but red feels it's important to always
    stay in touch with your feelings&mdash;and if that means some emotional
    swings, then that is just what was meant to be.</p>

  <p><strong>Impulse</strong>&mdash;Red doesn't have time for thinking. Thinking
    takes way too long. Red's competitive advantage is its speed and the
    ability to make big decisions instantaneously. The way red can
    accomplish this is by relying on its impulses to make the right call.
    Your gut is just so much faster than your brain.</p>

  <p><strong>Might (Solving problems through brawn)</strong>&mdash;If red has to
    choose between letting its mind solve a problem and letting its body
    solve it, red heavily leans towards the latter. Red has a lot of
    practice using action to get things done.</p>

  <p><strong>Violence</strong>&mdash;Red prefers blunt answers. One blunt answer
    is physical violence. Someone gets in your way, hit them until they
    fall down. That usually solves it... for now. But that's good enough.</p>

  <p><strong>Brutality</strong>&mdash;Some other colors draw a line between what
    is acceptable and what is not. Red blurs that line. Red prefers
    amicable resolutions&mdash;but if it finds other, more direct solutions, red
    has no problem using them.</p>

  <p><strong>Destruction</strong>&mdash;Red likes easy-to-remember plans of
    action. If a thing is a problem, there's a simple universal answer:
    Destroy the thing. To red, destruction is an art unto itself, and those
    who master the art have a lot fewer things bugging them.</p>

  <p><strong>Chaos</strong>&mdash;This is white's word, not red's. Red just
    wants things to run the way they want to run, and as we're dealing with
    humans, it's messy. But that mess contains the beauty red sees in the
    world. Each individual is living the life determined for them, and as
    different people's lives crash into one another, we start to understand
    the impact individuals have on the group. It seems disjointed from afar,
    but as you dig in deep you find that the inconsistencies, the variance,
    the flaws all add that extra layer of humanity.</p>

  <p><strong>Randomness</strong>&mdash;Life isn't orderly, so why should people
    act as if it is? Part of finding happiness is recognizing that things
    don't always happen for a reason; red has embraced randomness as an
    inevitable component of life.</p>

  <p><strong>Spontaneity</strong>&mdash;Red recognizes that one of the great
    joys of life is the ability to do what you want to do in the instant you
    want to do it. In order to allow this to happen as much as possible,
    red embraces the idea that things don't have to be planned ahead but
    rather can be created in the moment.</p>

  <p><strong>Humor</strong>&mdash;Red loves to laugh, and as such is the color
    that most actively creates and appreciates humor. The other four colors
    all have their own form of humor, but none are as blunt, as broad, or as
    entertaining as red's.</p>

  <p><strong>Mischievousness</strong>&mdash;Red enjoys doing things to entertain
    itself. One of those things is messing with other individuals. It's
    really funny when things don't go as others have planned.</p>

  <p><strong>The Elements of Fire and Earth</strong>&mdash;Red values the
    volatile side of these natural elements (lightning, fire, earthquakes,
    mudslides, etc.), and quite often uses them as the source of its direct
    damage.</p>

  <p><strong>Fighting (Brawling)</strong>&mdash;Red does not back down from a fight, but note that these fights are
    much more unstructured brawling than any formalized combat.</p>

  <p><strong>Romance</strong>&mdash;Red's a lover <em>and</em> a fighter. Just
    as red won't back down from a fight, red is also not afraid of letting
    others know how it feels. Red isn't scared of relationships. It knows
    that through close bonds with others, some of life's happiest moments
    happen.</p>

  <p><strong>Hedonism</strong>&mdash;Red embraces following your feelings. Most
    of the time, that means doing things you want to do because they're
    things you'd enjoy. Red sees no shame in delivering on this basic need.</p>

  <p><strong>Barbarism</strong>&mdash;The offshoot of valuing action over thought is that many times you act in a
    more primitive manner.</p>


  <h3>What Does Red Despise? What Negatively Drives Red?</h3>

  <p>Red doesn't like being frustrated or bored. The first happens when
    someone tries to inform red that it cannot do what it wants to do. Red's
    default reaction is to just do it anyway, but if something tries to
    stop red, red will figure out how to remove the obstacle in its way. Red
    likes to see itself as an unstoppable force that will just keep taking
    action until it get what it wants.</p>

  <p>Red's other pet peeve is when nothing is happening. Red is a color of
    action, so anything leading to inaction drives red crazy. Red has no
    patience nor long-term plan, so the last thing it wants to do is not do
    anything. Red would much rather fail miserably than sit back and never
    try.</p>


  <h3>Why Does Red Like Its Allies And Hate Its Enemies?</h3>

  <p>Red looks at black and sees a color guided by an internal voice, not
    external ones. Black also values the ability to do what it wants, and it
    understands the importance of destruction. Black plans and plots a
    little more than red likes, and is a bit more selfish than even red is
    comfortable with, but overall black is a color that red can identify
    with.</p>

  <p>Green embraces its instinct and, like red, can act without needing to
    think about it first. Green has a wild side that red appreciates. Green
    is also big on "might making right," a concept that red can get behind.
    Green is a little more orderly than red would prefer and, at times, a
    bit more serene than red can handle; but it's definitely a color that
    red feels at home with.</p>

  <p>Red looks at white and sees a color that seems to exist solely to
    complicate things unnecessarily. White's obsession with rules and laws
    creates system after system designed to prevent red from doing what it
    wants to do. Even worse, it has the tools to enforce its structure.
    Scariest of all, white has the means to imprison red, along with the
    infrastructure to falsely justify such an action. This leads to the
    worst possible outcome for red: a complete loss of freedom.</p>

  <p>Red sees blue as a danger, because blue lives to undercut the value
    of feelings. If blue had its way, individuals would be emotionless
    automatons never knowing what it was to experience raw emotions. In
    addition, blue's mission seems to be to make nothing happen. Blue wants
    to destroy red's way of life, and bore red to death in the process.</p>


  <h3>What Is Red's Greatest Strength And Biggest Weakness?</h3>

  <p>Red's greatest strength is its ability to know what it wants. Red has
    purpose and clarity. In addition, red is committed to taking action to
    get the things it wants. Others might pine for things; red actively
    takes the steps to acquire them. This drive grants red a passion and
    speed that can often overwhelm its adversaries. Red's enthusiasm creates
    an energy that allows it to do amazing things.</p>

  <p>Red's greatest weakness is an unwillingness to think long-term. Red
    is very short-sighted, trying to accomplish what it wants right now and
    seldom thinking of the ramifications of its actions. Red often puts all
    its eggs in one basket, and if that plan doesn't work out, red can
    easily get itself in trouble. In addition to all that, red is very bad
    at taking advice from others, choosing to follow its own path even when
    everyone around it is saying that disaster awaits.</p>

  <h3>Red Characters In Pop Culture</h3>

  <p><strong>Helena (Orphan Black)</strong></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Knux (Mad Max: Fury Road)</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Throughout the movie, Knux makes decisions moment-to-moment, because

      film.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Quicksilver (Avengers: Age of Ultron)</strong></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>All the Emotions (Inside Out)</strong></p>

      sorts of ramifications.</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p><strong>Mabel Pines (Gravity Falls)</strong></p>

      project, which usually has near-disastrous implications for the people
      around her.</p>
  </blockquote>
