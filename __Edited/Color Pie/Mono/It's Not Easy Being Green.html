  <h1>It's Not Easy Being Green</h1>

  <h3>What Does Green Desire? What Is Its End Goal?</h3>

  <p>Green wants acceptance.</p>

  <p>The other colors are all focused on how they'd change the world to
    make it better. Green is the one color that doesn't want to change the
    world, because green is convinced that the world already got everything
    right. The natural order is a thing of beauty and has all the answers to
    life's problems. The key is learning to sit back and recognize what is
    right in front of you.</p>

  <p>Each individual is born with all the potential they need. The secret
    to a happy life is to recognize the role you were born into and then
    embrace it. Do what you were destined to do. The world is this elaborate
    system, and each one of us gets to play a part. And it's not something
    we have to guess about; it's imprinted on us, it's in our genes. Just
    look within.</p>

  <p>In addition, you have to learn how you fit into the larger picture.
    Nature has a beautiful structure. Part of life is recognizing what role
    you play and how that role interconnects with the web of life. You're
    not alone. You're part of a complex system full of interdependencies.</p>

  <p>The problem is there's so much going on that it's easy to lose track
    of what's already there. Too many individuals get so caught up in the
    details of their lives that they don't bother to sit back and understand
    the bigger picture. Green truly believes that the rest of the colors
    simply aren't taking the time to appreciate what is already there.</p>


  <h3>What Means Does Green Use To Achieve These Ends?</h3>

  <p>If individuals won't take the time to come to nature, well then green
    will have to bring nature to them. Green believes that once you
    understand what life has to offer, you will accept its gifts. The key is
    to find ways to help others see what green already sees.</p>

  <p>Green's greatest tool in its quest to help others appreciate what it
    already sees is nature itself, and this plays out in a number of
    different ways.</p>

  <p>Green has a special bond with creatures, especially the ones living
    in the wild that are tapped into the ecosystem. This means that green is
    more of a creature color than the others (although white tends to have
    lots and lots of small creatures that band together for strength). It
    means green has access to larger and more vicious creatures. Green puts
    this arsenal of wild animals to good use.</p>

  <p>Green is also closely tied to the land. This helps green in numerous
    ways. It allows green to find new connections faster and to accumulate
    mana at a swifter speed than the other colors. This allows green to both
    cast larger spells faster and to gain access to other colors of mana
    more easily.</p>

  <p>Green is also very connected to life itself and has the ability to
    rejuvenate. Tied closely to this is green's connection with growth,
    which it can use to overwhelm others. Green's close bond with the
    natural order means that it can speed up natural processes that might
    normally take much more time.</p>

  <p>All of this, though, is green using the elements of nature as a means
    to show off what nature can do. Because once again, green truly feels
    that the one thing keeping individuals from accepting the truth of the
    world is a lack of understanding. There's an inner harmony that's
    necessary in order to be able to take in what's all around you, and
    green works hard to allow individuals to tap into that harmony.</p>


  <h3>What Does Green Care About? What Does Green Represent?</h3>

  <p>Here are a bunch of core things important to green:</p>

  <p><strong>Life (birth)</strong>&mdash;One of the most potent forces of nature
    is the creation of new life. Green recognizes this as a key strength,
    and does everything it can to foster and honor the ability.</p>

  <p><strong>Growth</strong>&mdash;Green is not about doing nothing. Nature
    itself is very active. As others twiddle their thumbs, the world is
    slowly but constantly growing. This unstoppable force of change is
    another very powerful element of nature, and it's something green taps
    into whenever possible.</p>

  <p><strong>Nature (and natural things)</strong>&mdash;Green makes a big
    distinction between things that are naturally made and things that are
    artificially made. The first is a great gift from the world, and the
    second is an abomination. The world is creating amazing things. Green
    admires them and is always on the lookout for ways to make use of them
    to aid in green's quest.</p>

  <p><strong>Reality (in contrast to illusion)</strong>&mdash;Truth is another
    potent force in the world. Green promotes truth because it reveals what
    actually is. Other colors try to misrepresent life, using lies and
    propaganda to mislead individuals to keep them from seeing the truth. As
    such, green is adamant about shutting down anything that misrepresents
    reality.</p>

  <p><strong>Community</strong>&mdash;We are not isolated individuals but an
    interconnected web. Part of embracing green's philosophy is
    understanding the importance of how each of us figures into the lives of
    the others. Grasping the role this larger group plays is a vital piece
    in understanding how the world works.</p>

  <p><strong>Interdependence</strong>&mdash;Nothing exists in a vacuum. Each
    individual's actions have consequences to the individuals around them.
    Part of accepting the message that green is trying to share with the
    world is realizing that you co-exist with so many others.</p>

  <p><strong>Spiritualism</strong>&mdash;Green leaves religion to white, but it
    very much believes in the importance of accepting higher forces at play.
    Things don't just happen, they happen for a reason. The
    interconnectivity of nature doesn't just occur on a physical level, it
    happens on a much higher plane of understanding as well.</p>

  <p><strong>The Past</strong>&mdash;Of all the colors, green is the most backwards-looking, as it believes that
    your future is very much determined by your past.</p>

  <p><strong>Wisdom</strong>&mdash;Blue looks to the future and seeks knowledge,
    green looks to the past and seeks wisdom. Green believes that the
    secret to success today is understanding the successes and failures of
    those who came before you.</p>

  <p><strong>Ancestry</strong>&mdash;If who you are is in your genes, then who you come from is of utmost
    importance.</p>

  <p><strong>Tradition</strong>&mdash;Green believes that we need to be
    constantly touching the past, and a great way to do that is through
    traditions where you get to continue activities passed down through time
    by your ancestors.</p>

  <p><strong>Instinct</strong>&mdash;Nature provides motivation through biology.
    Most creatures, for example, don't think about what they're going to
    do. They just do what comes naturally to them. To embrace green's
    philosophy is to understand that that those feelings are found not just
    in animals but in every living creature.</p>

  <p><strong>Animals</strong>&mdash;The less civilized you are, the more you
    instinctively understand the role of nature. Animals, especially wild
    ones, connect with nature in a way that is hard for more sapient
    creatures to understand.</p>

  <p><strong>Plants</strong>&mdash;Green's connection with living things doesn't
    stop with animals. Green is just as concerned about the flora as it is
    about the fauna.</p>


  <h3>What Does Green Despise? What Negatively Drives Green?</h3>

  <p>Green accepts that change is a part of the natural process. What
    green can't stand is unnatural change, where an outside force alters
    something that was not meant to be changed. This comes out in two
    different ways. The first is when someone creates something that was
    never supposed to exist. This dislike of man-made things is a big reason
    that green hates artifacts (and to a lesser extent, enchantments).
    There is no greater slap to the face than someone trying to usurp the
    natural process of creation.</p>

  <p>Second, green can't stand things being removed from nature
    inorganically. The ecosystem is so carefully balanced that the unnatural
    removal of a component can throw everything off. Kill a bunch of
    predators and, all of the sudden, the prey start growing in number. This
    can have devastating consequences if left unchecked.</p>

  <p>Basically, green feels a strong connection with the status quo, so
    any attempt to change it through artificial means makes green very
    angry.</p>


  <h3>Why Does Green Like Its Allies And Hate Its Enemies?</h3>

  <p>Green looks at white and sees a fellow color that understands the
    importance of community&mdash;making these two colors the ones most reliant on
    creatures. White also has a very peaceful side that green can connect
    with. Green's biggest problem with white is that it doesn't understand
    the wild side of green that gives in to its base urges.</p>

  <p>In contrast, green sees red as a color that does embrace its wild
    side. Green is a little more instinctual while red is more impulsive,
    but both colors understand the internal draw to do things you feel
    compelled you must. Red is also a color, like green, with access to lots
    of mana and a larger stable of giant creatures. Finally, green can
    connect with red's destructive side, as green recognizes that quality of
    nature. Green's biggest issue with red is that red is too focused on
    what it wants and never thinks about the consequences of its actions to
    those around it.</p>

  <p>If green leans towards nature, blue leans towards nurture. Blue has
    this false notion that individuals have complete say on who they are.
    Blue not only fails to acknowledge what comes from within, it also
    spends lots of time and energy trying to become something else. Blue is
    the color most intent on creating artificial items, with complete
    disregard for anything natural. Blue and green both seek to educate, but
    while green looks to the wisdom of the past, blue is obsessed with the
    unknown of the future. Blue not only prevents green from getting out its
    message, it constantly misleads individuals by offering them a false
    path.</p>

  <p>Green looks at black and sees a color intent on destroying everything
    green holds dear. Black is power-hungry and has no conscience to keep
    it in check. Black kills wantonly and dangerously, wrecking ecosystems
    left and right. Green sees death for what it is: a key component in the
    great circle of life. Black sees it as a weapon, and through misuse of
    it threatens the very system green cares most about. How can green
    introduce everyone to the natural world around them if black destroys
    it? Also, black does not understand that one's role in life is
    predetermined&mdash;it acts out trying to prove that it has free will.</p>


  <h3>What Is Green's Greatest Strength And Biggest Weakness?</h3>

  <p>Green's greatest strength is its absolute, unwavering belief in the
    natural system. Green embraces nature and is able to connect with it
    through that bond and use it in ways that are primal and very powerful.
    This connection also allows green access to many giant creatures that
    serve as muscle to help green push forward its agenda.</p>

  <p>Green's weakness is its over-reliance on this system. For example,
    green is so focused on using creatures that there are a number of
    problems green simply can't deal with when it doesn't have creatures. In
    short, green puts too many eggs in one basket&mdash;and when that basket
    doesn't have the answer, green is often at loss for solving its
    problems.</p>
