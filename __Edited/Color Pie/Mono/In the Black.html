  <h1>In the Black</h1>

  <h3>What Does Black Desire? What Is Its End Goal?</h3>

  <p>Black wants power.</p>

  <p>Black looks at all the other colors and feels that each of them sees
    the world as they wish it to be. Black is the only realist, the only
    color to look and see the world as it is. An individual is free to have
    whatever they want, provided they have the power to obtain and keep it.
    This makes power the most important resource, because it's the one thing
    that can guarantee your ability to control your life and thus your
    happiness.</p>

  <p>It's important for everyone to understand that black didn't make the
    world greedy. The world was already greedy; black has just learned how
    to thrive within it. Black has two big things on its side. One, it
    understands and accepts the system better than anyone else. And two,
    black doesn't place any restrictions on itself that make its success
    more difficult.</p>

  <p>Black's philosophy is very simple: There's no one better suited to
    look after your own interests than you. Therefore, if everyone looks out
    after their own interests, you've created a system where everyone has
    someone looking out for them. In addition, black's system allows
    everyone the opportunity to succeed. Will everyone succeed? Of course
    not&mdash;but once again, that's not black's doing. That's just how the world
    works.</p>

  <p>The weak will fail. That's what makes them the weak. Doing anything
    to help them is both prolonging the inevitable and risking failing
    alongside them. It's not personal to black. Black does what it needs to
    do to succeed. If others can't do the same, well, then they deserve
    their fate. Others see this as black being heartless, but black realizes
    it's just being pragmatic.</p>

  <p>There will always be those who suffer. Once again, this isn't black's
    doing. It's an inevitability of life. Black's just the one color that
    owns up to the truth and acts accordingly.</p>

  <h3>What Means Does Black Use To Achieve These Ends?</h3>

  <p>Black believes the key to success is its ability to take advantage of
    any opportunity. Other colors come up with reasons why they can't do
    something; black doesn't have that limitation. If black needs something,
    it can't let anything stand in the way. This means no taboos, no
    restrictions, no rules, no morals, no sympathy, no hesitation, and no
    regret. If you see something that will advance your agenda and help you
    acquire more power, you take it.</p>

  <p>Black watches as others create reasons why something is off limits.
    Black can have no such weakness. Life is hard. Individuals don't have
    the luxury of passing by opportunities. One must take advantage of every
    opportunity, no matter the cost. These choices often come at a steep
    price, but that's the key to success&mdash;accepting that things you need will
    come with a cost that you will have to pay.</p>

  <p>Because of this philosophy, black makes use of many resources that
    others reject. For instance, one of black's most effective weapons is
    death. The other colors feel it is "wrong" to meddle with such a force,
    but to black, not making use of something as powerful as death is the
    true crime.</p>

  <p>This is another reason that black is so centered on itself. Many
    costs require the sacrifice of others for your own advancement. Because
    it puts itself first, black is always willing to make this trade. The
    weak must fall for the strong to thrive.</p>

  <p>Others will try to flavor black's choices as somehow inherently
    wrong, but black understands that results are what matter, not
    perception. Caring what others think of you is a weakness.</p>

  <h3>What Does Black Care About? What Does Black Represent?</h3>

  <p>Here are a number of things black cares about, and why:</p>

  <p><strong>Death</strong>&mdash;Death is a potent and powerful force that most
    others write off due to taboos. Black doesn't care about taboos. Black
    cares about results, and death is an effective tool. As such, death has
    become a major weapon of black.</p>

  <p><strong>Undead</strong>&mdash;Death is not an end but often a beginning.
    Black makes use of not just death but dead things. Others have issues
    with making use of the dead, but black knows they make great servants.</p>

  <p><strong>Amorality</strong>&mdash;Black is not immoral, as black doesn't
    believe in the concept of morality. Morality is a human construction
    meant to allow the weak to justify a false position of strength over
    those more powerful than themselves. Life is not divided into good and
    evil but rather into what must be done and what needn't be done.</p>

  <p><strong>Fear</strong>&mdash;Of all the emotions, fear is the one that black
    has found to grant it the easiest time getting what it wants quickly.
    Fear tends to motivate individuals to do whatever it takes to remove
    themselves from the situation that's making them afraid. Black has found
    this to be a very effective tool, and thus uses it often.</p>

  <p><strong>Sadness/Depression</strong>&mdash;If you need someone to act
    quickly, you use fear. If you need someone to be inactive, this is
    black's favorite emotion to get the job done.</p>

  <p><strong>Pain</strong>&mdash;This is another great motivator shunned by
    others. If you can do something simple that gains compliance, why
    wouldn't you use it?</p>

  <p><strong>Torture</strong>&mdash;Black never shies away from effective tools.</p>

  <p><strong>Darkness</strong>&mdash;First, no one can tell what you're doing in
    the dark, which makes it easier for black to get away with things.
    Second, it scares people, so that's a big plus. Third, the kinds of
    creatures that black tends to make use of often live and thrive in the
    dark. And finally, it represents keeping things hidden, which black has
    found to aid in accomplishing its goals.</p>

  <p><strong>Disease</strong>&mdash;Like death, disease is a potent and powerful
    force that most others shun due to silly taboos. It's effective,
    spreads easily and makes others weak&mdash;all things that work in black's
    favor.</p>

  <p><strong>Decay/Entropy</strong>&mdash;Things get weaker over time. Black has found this to be yet another
    natural force that it can bend to its desires.</p>

  <p><strong>Parasitism</strong>&mdash;The strong feed off of the weak. This is true from the micro to the macro.</p>

  <p><strong>Insects/Spiders</strong>&mdash;Others shy away from creepy, crawly things. Only more reason for black
    to use them.</p>

  <p><strong>Vermin</strong>&mdash;They're scary and carry disease. Win-win.</p>

  <p><strong>Corruption</strong>&mdash;Individuals are inherently selfish. Black
    takes advantage of this universal truth, causing others to benefit
    themselves while helping black out.</p>

  <p><strong>Impurity/Contamination</strong>&mdash;Purity takes a lot of work,
    while contamination takes very little. A barrel full of sewage with a
    thimble full of wine is sewage; a barrel full of wine with a thimble
    full of sewage is also sewage. A little contamination can go a long way
    toward helping black achieve its goals.</p>

  <p><strong>Reduction</strong>&mdash;Black has proven much better at removing things than creating things.</p>

  <p><strong>Deceit</strong>&mdash;Many individuals put value in truth. They are
    fools. The illusion of truth as a force to be trusted is just an
    opportunity waiting to be taken advantage of.</p>

  <p><strong>Manipulation</strong>&mdash;If others won't do things because you
    asked nicely, just stop asking nicely. Once again, self-interest can be
    used to get individuals to do what you need them to do.</p>

  <p><strong>Machevelian Thinking ("The ends justify the means")</strong>&mdash;The
    means are meaningless. People who put value in them are wasting their
    strength in the wrong place. Who cares why or who or how? In the end,
    results are all that actually matter.</p>

  <p><strong>Individualism</strong>&mdash;Black's philosophy on self-reliance stresses how important it is for
    individuals to be able to look after themselves.</p>

  <p><strong>Destruction (calculated)</strong>&mdash;The weak focus on things
    that take more time and energy. The strong are the ones that understand
    where true strength lies. Destruction is far easier than creation.
    Therefore, black relies on destruction as a tool to accomplish what it
    needs. Note that unlike red, this destruction is not short-sighted but
    part of a larger goal.</p>

  <p><strong>Sacrifice of Others</strong>&mdash;Sometimes it takes sacrifice to get things done. Always starts with
    those that aren't yourself.</p>

  <p><strong>Sacrifices of Pieces of Self</strong>&mdash;Note though that
    sometimes you are going to have to be the one to sacrifice. What sets
    black apart is a willingness to do this when it is the most efficient
    course of action.</p>

  <p><strong>Execution</strong>&mdash;Death can be a motivating force to others if you can make a big show of it.</p>

  <p><strong>Self-Absorption</strong>&mdash;If you're the most important, why wouldn't you spend more time and
    energy on yourself?</p>

  <h3>What Does Black Despise? What Negatively Drives Black?</h3>

  <p>Black can't stand when others seem to reject the basic truths of
    life. For example, there are those who are willing to do things not for
    the good of themselves but rather for the good of others at the expense
    of themselves. Black considers these individuals to be idiots; dangerous
    idiots, because they take away black's ability to motivate them. Fear,
    pain, threat of death&mdash;what do you do when individuals would rather
    suffer than do what you want them to do?</p>

  <p>Black is baffled by the various self-made forces that get people to
    act against their own self-interest. On one level, black is intrigued,
    wondering if there are things it could learn from these forces in order
    to fool individuals into believing they want to do what black needs them
    to do. But these forces also scare black, because they undercut many of
    the certainties black has built its entire philosophy around.</p>

  <h3>Why Does Black Like Its Allies And Hate Its Enemies?</h3>

  <p>Black looks at blue and sees a fellow color that understands the need
    to manipulate and use trickery to get what it wants. Black appreciates
    that blue values information and uses that information as a means to
    achieve goals. Black understands blue's desire to have an emotional
    detachment with which to examine the world and do things that others
    often do not understand. Black likes blue's love of technology and its
    willingness to always find new tools to get the job done. Black dislikes
    that blue, at times, works towards the good of the group rather than
    the individual. Black also dislikes that blue is often motivated less by
    self-interest than by a desire to learn.</p>

  <p>Black looks at red and sees a fellow color that isn't afraid to
    embrace its destructive side. Black likes that red looks within to make
    decisions and can put itself first. Black appreciates red's willingness
    to use violence and pain to encourage others to see things red's way.
    Black likes that red is able to ignore what others think of red and do
    what it feels is the correct thing for itself. Black doesn't like that
    red is short-sighted and often does things without understanding the
    repercussions. Black also doesn't like that red is willing at times to
    sacrifice itself for the sake of its loved ones.</p>

  <p>Black thinks that white is dangerous. It coddles the weak and
    encourages them to work together. Even crazier, it created morality as
    an insidious tool to convince individuals to act against their own
    self-interest. Black realizes that white is a crafty enemy that, if left
    unchecked, threatens to jeopardize everything black has worked for.
    White is a master at propaganda, and has convinced the world that black
    is "evil" and must be stopped at all costs. Black can appreciate the
    cleverness of what white has done, but will stop at nothing until white
    and its minions are all dead.</p>

  <p>Black realizes that green is also dangerous, but in a more subtle
    way. Green makes use of resources that black has less control over.
    Animals, for instance, work off of instinct and thus cannot be as easily
    motivated by such things as self-interest. Green also has tools that
    directly fight against many of black's tools. Life versus death or
    growth versus decay. Green, like white, is community-oriented and is
    able to pull together hordes of creatures that can overwhelm black's
    resources. Finally, green philosophically opposes an important tenet of
    black's philosophy, believing that individuals have the power to choose
    their own paths in life. Green's deterministic nature contradicts
    black's important belief in free will.</p>

  <h3>What Is Black's Greatest Strength And Biggest Weakness?</h3>

  <p>Black's greatest strength is its willingness to do whatever is needed
    to get what black wants. Nothing is off limits to black, and that makes
    fighting against it tricky. Black is willing to do things that other
    colors cannot bring themselves to do. On the downside, black's
    willingness to do whatever it takes can often get black into trouble.
    Black will make calculated risks that will at times end up hurting
    black. In some ways, black's greatest enemy is not the other colors but
    itself; the color most likely to be responsible for black's downfall is
    black.</p>
