  <h1>True Blue</h1>

  <h3>What Does Blue Desire? What Is Its End Goal?</h3>

  <p>Blue wants perfection.</p>

  <p>Blue believes that each and every one of us is born a blank slate
    with the potential to become anything. The entire point of life is
    figuring out what you could achieve with the right education,
    experience, and tools. Note that this is not a task with an end goal,
    but one that continues throughout your life. There will always be things
    you can do to improve, change, or adapt. The journey of life is one of
    constant discovery as you keep seeking to better yourself.</p>

  <p>In order for individuals to do this, there has to be a society that
    accepts and encourages this behavior. Opportunities for education are
    vital. Places to experience things through trial and
    error&nbsp;are&nbsp;mandatory. Access to the top-of-the-line tools needs
    to be a right of every citizen.</p>

  <p>In addition, this way of living requires the right attitude. You have
    to be open to possibilities, but also not too hasty in action. Blue
    recognizes that there are many forces, even some that come from within,
    that lead an individual astray. Time is a valuable resource because only
    with time can one get the things they need to improve. This means that
    individuals need to be careful and deliberate in all their decision
    making. It is better to think one's options out carefully and select
    correctly, than to rush to a decision.</p>

  <p>Blue is methodical and exact. Because when one sets out to become the
    best individual they can be, one doesn't have the luxury of making
    mistakes. Well, not unless they occur within a controlled environment.</p>

  <p>Much as blue wishes to perfect itself, it also wants to perfect the
    world it lives in. Part of this is to ensure that blue has access to the
    resources it needs, but part of it is the belief that an element of
    reaching one's potential is living within a world that has reached its
    own potential. As such, blue is the color most interested in technology
    and wants the latest and greatest version of whatever it is using.</p>


  <h3>What Means Does Blue Use To Achieve These Ends?</h3>

  <p>If reaching one's potential is the goal, the most valuable tool is
    information. You have to first figure out what your potential is and
    then you have to track down the means by which you can reach it. The
    trick is that you don't always know what information is the piece you'll
    need, so blue has decided to just collect as much information as
    possible. Knowledge is the ultimate tool and is most effective in the
    hands of the person that has the most.</p>

  <p>The net result of this way of thinking is that blue values the
    acquisition of any and all knowledge. Individuals with a blue bent are
    constantly interested in learning everything they do not know and have
    an insatiable quest to learn more. To blue, the act of learning is its
    own reward and is something that must be constantly encouraged.</p>

  <p>Information can be used in numerous ways other than as a means of
    improvement. First, it can be a tool of control. By releasing and
    withholding pieces of information, you can force others to act or not
    act. Second, it serves as a key. Access is often open to those that know
    the proper words or actions. Third, it can be a form of protection.
    Knowing what threats could appear can keep you safe. Fourth, it can be a
    weapon. The right secret in the right place at the right time can be
    just as destructive as the mightiest bomb.</p>

  <p>In order to facilitate the flow of information, blue wants a
    structure that enables information to be gathered. Blue likes
    universities,&nbsp;libraries, and laboratories. Blue wants to surround
    itself with others also invested in learning. It also likes a highly
    structured system where its knowledge of that system will give it an
    edge.</p>


  <h3>What Does Blue Care About? What Does Blue Represent?</h3>

  <p>Here are a number of things that blue cares about along with why:</p>

  <p><strong>Academics&mdash;</strong>If education is the key, then having places to learn is a necessity. Blue
    is a big supporter of any and all educational systems.</p>

  <p><strong>Books &amp; Other Repositories of Information&mdash;</strong>Blue
    values any tool that it can use to gather and store information. It
    treats these items as something special and values them highly.</p>

  <p><strong>Mind/Thought&mdash;</strong>Blue values intellect, and as such is
    the color that is most often representative of the brain or any means of
    thinking. Blue is the color most often associated with the mind and any
    form of logical thought.</p>

  <p><strong>Memory&mdash;</strong>Blue is the color most interested in the idea
    of how one's memory ties into what an individual knows and does not
    know. A valuable way to deprive others of information or to give them
    misinformation is to mess with their memory.</p>

  <p><strong>Telepathy&mdash;</strong>If knowledge is key, then the ability to
    get it directly out of others' minds is a valuable tool, one blue is
    willing to make use of.</p>

  <p><strong>Telekinesis&mdash;</strong>Another means of accomplishing physical
    tasks with the mind is making use of mental energy directly to perform
    physical actions. As such, mind over matter is another blue tool.</p>

  <p><strong>Messing with Time&mdash;</strong>Yet another resource blue messes
    around with is the very fabric of time itself. Blue's studies have
    helped it uncover secrets that none of the other colors are privy to,
    how to use time as both a resource and a weapon.</p>

  <p><strong>Control&mdash;</strong>Blue doesn't always have the skills it needs
    to accomplish its tasks, so it has learned the value of using its
    resource to control those who do. It's an example of a mental process
    helping solve a physical problem.</p>

  <p><strong>Manipulation&mdash;</strong>Similar to control, manipulation is a
    way to use information as a tool to get things done. Blue feels that it
    has a better understanding of the bigger picture and thus manipulation
    is a necessary tool to get those that don't understand it moving in the
    right direction.</p>

  <p><strong>Trickery&mdash;</strong>Yet another way to use information as a means of accomplishing a task.</p>

  <p><strong>Subtlety&mdash;</strong>Blue's obsession with details often allows
    it to function in ways others might not notice. Blue does not want to
    risk even the tiniest detail derailing its plans.</p>

  <p><strong>Complexity&mdash;</strong>Another means of controlling things is to
    overwhelm others with too much information. Blue is the color that
    enjoys complex systems and uses them, at times, as a means to disrupt
    others.</p>

  <p><strong>Artifice&mdash;</strong>Blue's belief in the value of manipulation
    and trickery make it willing to create things that are not real in an
    attempt to confuse others.</p>

  <p><strong>Illusion&mdash;</strong>This type of magic, which thrives on the
    ignorance of others, plays straight into blue's strength. It is
    interesting to blue that this type of magic's weakness is knowledge,
    meaning it can never be used effectively against blue.</p>

  <p><strong>Construction/Technology&mdash;</strong>Blue believes strongly in the importance of tools, so it is
    on the cutting edge of the resources needed to create them.</p>

  <p><strong>Artifacts&mdash;</strong>As the color that loves technology, blue
    is the color that has the closest tie to artifacts. It both uses them
    the most and has the easiest time manipulating them.</p>

  <p><strong>Man-Made Items&mdash;</strong>Blue is the color willing to manufacture whatever is
    needed. Blue cares in the function of an item, not its origin.</p>

  <p><strong>Passivity&mdash;</strong>Blue's reliance in thinking out solutions makes it the color which most
    often makes use of inaction.</p>

  <p><strong>Cold&mdash;</strong>Blue's resistance to emotion makes it
    metaphorically the coldest, and this thematic connection carries over to
    its magic. Cold has proven a powerful tool, as a means of preventing
    things from happening.</p>

  <p><strong>Elements of Water/Air&mdash;</strong>Air and water represent mental
    processes metaphorically, and have become physical attributes the color
    leans toward. This also plays into blue's conflict with red, which
    support the elements of fire and earth.</p>


  <h3>What Does Blue Despise? What Negatively Drives Blue?</h3>

  <p>Blue is careful and adept at plotting, and thus is resistant to any
    forces that might force an individual to make a hasty decision. As such,
    blue dislikes both impulse and instinct. Impulses stem from emotional
    responses and those are the opposite of intellect. Emotions spur
    short-sighted actions that satisfy quick-term feelings, but usually at
    the cost of long-term complications. Blue knows that in order to be
    successful, you have to keep the big picture in mind and value each
    decision against the consequences it produces.</p>

  <p>Blue dislikes instinct because it represents the shortcomings of
    biology. Evolution is a painfully slow process, meaning physical
    reactions are often the result of reacting to problems that have long
    ago died off. Being a slave to the past is illogical&nbsp;and damaging
    to blue's larger goals.</p>

  <p>Blue also cannot stand any system or process that contradicts the
    need for progress or change. A big impediment to an individual finding
    their potential is the denial that such potential either exists or that
    it has value. Blue thus strongly dislikes traditions and ceremony.</p>


  <h3>Why Does Blue Like Its Allies And Hate Its Enemies?</h3>

  <p>Blue looks at white and sees a fellow color that understands the need
    to plan and look ahead. Blue admires white's dedication to structure
    and appreciates its desire to find and fix flaws. Blue is a little
    frustrated with white's inflexibility and its inability to understand
    the value of the individual. White also upholds many traditions and
    ceremonies, which blue feels is unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Blue looks at black and appreciates its pragmatism and willingness to
    do what it needs to do to improve and change. Blue also likes that
    black values education and tools. Blue's frustration with black lies in
    the influence it allows its emotions to have in decision-making and the
    complete disregard of the importance of the group.</p>

  <p>Blue looks at red and sees a color that has given in to its emotions,
    resulting in short-term thinking that jeopardizes long-term goals. Red
    is reckless and unreliable, as well as destructive and impulsive. Its
    actions fly in the face of how blue believes individuals need to
    function.</p>

  <p>Blue looks at green and sees a color that believes in nature over
    nurture. Green denies the very idea that individuals can shape their own
    future, instead believing in crazy concepts like destiny and
    predetermination. Green fights the things that blue centers its
    philosophy around.</p>


  <h3>What Is Blue's Greatest Strength And Biggest Weakness?</h3>

  <p>Blue's greatest strength is its use of knowledge as a tool. Blue
    values information and thus prioritizes not just its acquisition but
    also its use. Blue takes the time to examine the big picture and figure
    out what the consequences are of each action. Blue never acts carelessly
    or without great thought.</p>

  <p>The negative impact of this style of action is that blue can often be
    very passive. One of the dangers of thinking everything through is the
    inability to be quick in decision making or be spontaneous in action.
    Blue will, at times, miss out because other colors have taken the
    initiative.</p>

  <p>Also, blue ends up being very reactive, often waiting for others to
    take action before doing anything itself. This can cause blue to
    sometimes have problems when its opponents aren't being proactive.</p>
