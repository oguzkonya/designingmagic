  <h1>Nuts &amp; Bolts: Higher Rarities</h1>

  <p>The "something big" that happened is what R&amp;D calls New World Order (NWO). New World Order was something
    R&amp;D originally put into place to help lower the barrier to entry for
    new players but ended up also bringing clarity to the game. The end
    result for design is the NWO forces us to be more conscious about how
    much complexity is going on at common.</p>

  <p>Here are some NWO questions you have to ask yourself while filling in the common slots:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How difficult is this card to understand? Can you read it and
      then understand what it does? We call this comprehension complexity.
      Cards that aren't very clear tend to be moved to higher rarities or even
      just removed altogether.</li>
    <li>How much interaction does this card have with the other cards on
      the battlefield? Does having this one card make you have to reevaluate
      every other card on the battlefield? We call this board complexity.
      Cards that significantly raise the number of options available on
      permanents on the battlefield tend to be moved to higher rarities.
      Another way to think of it is this: If your card has the ability to
      affect numerous other permanents in play, unless that use is very
      restricted, we tend to push the card up to at least uncommon.</li>
    <li>Does this card add extra strategic evaluation? Will a better player
      gain advantage from understanding how best to use it? We call this
      strategic complexity. As long as this card does not break either of the
      two previous rules, we like having this type of card at common. This
      helps add a layer for the advanced player without making the game any
      harder to learn.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_004.jpg" alt=""> <img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_008.jpg"
      alt=""></p>

  <p>Note that you do get to have some complexity at common but it's
    restricted. As such, you need to make sure the complex cards you do have
    are helping you advance the major themes of your set. A common card
    that is setting off red flags (what R&amp;D calls common cards that are
    breaking a guideline, meaning they have to be checked over before they
    stay at common) but isn't a key part of your design needs to move up to
    higher rarities or be stricken from the set. Be aware that being in
    theme doesn't allow a card that's overly complex for common to stay in
    common.</p>

  <p>Another common issue that NWO cares about is one of focus. Most new <b>Magic</b>
    sets will make players care about something they don't normally care
    about. That's okay, but to help keep the set from being too complex, you
    have to choose your key focus point and restrict yourself to that (at
    common). For example,<i> Zendikar</i> cared about your land drop. That's not something players normally
    care about, but for <i>Zendikar</i> it was okay because that was the focus. Notice that the set didn't
    also make you care about some other aspect.</p>

  <p>The lesson here is that your set should have some focus but you need
    to limit yourself to that focus. In other words, don't have five cards
    care about Thing A, five care about Thing B, and five care about Thing
    C. Instead, have fifteen care about Thing A. Note that you can have
    variance within that focus. <i>Zendikar</i>, once again, made caring about lands matter in multiple ways
    but it stuck to land drops as being the focus.</p>

  <p>I'm going to talk about uncommons in a second, but before I do, I
    need to stress one last time that it's important to complete your
    commons before advancing onto the uncommons. Your first playtest wants
    to be all common because it's the best way to make sure your themes and
    mechanics are loud enough and focused enough. The higher rarities will
    allow you to add more complexity (which is a good thing&mdash;New World Order
    isn't trying eliminate all complexity, just to contain it to fewer cards
    per booster opening) but that complexity can make it harder to
    ascertain what your set is doing.</p>

  <p>A good design maxim is "Don't advance beyond common until your commons are getting the job done."</p>

  <h3>The Uncommons</h3>

  <p>It's not important to do your uncommon design skeleton until the
    commons are roughly done. The reason is, the act of doing the commons
    will most often inform what uncommons need. What I tend to like doing is
    making a blank uncommon skeleton and only fill it in with requirements
    that come up while doing commons. These tend to be:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Inevitably, when you make commons, you will discover you have
      cards that don't fit at common. Part of this will be because of the New
      World Order, but an equal part will simply be running out of room. When
      you start a set, you have lots of cool ideas, and what you find is that
      the commons get cramped very quickly. The key to solving this problem is
      figuring out what needs to stay at common and what can be addressed at
      uncommon or higher rarities.</li>
    <li>While designing your commons, you will hit upon the major themes of
      your set. Once you figure out what those are, you need to continue
      those themes at the higher rarities&mdash;especially uncommon. Going up in
      rarity will not only allow you to hit the themes again but also explore
      those themes in ways that wouldn't mechanically work at common</li>
    <li>Tied to the last point, when working on commons, often you will
      come up with ideas that are too complex for common. In fact, it's a
      running joke in design that one of the ways I get uncommon cards is to
      ask my design team to design commons. Commons are very hard to make, and
      it's quite easy when creating them to make cool cards that aren't
      really common. When I get cards I like but I know can't be common, I'll
      throw them into an uncommon slot to remind me that I'd like to work them
      in if I can.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once I have a working set of commons and start working on my
    uncommons, I like to make a list of all the things I've accumulated that
    I want to consider for uncommon. These things will fall into three
    categories.</p>

  <p>First will be things that are necessary because they follow up on
    things you've established in common. For instance, you will have chosen
    your major focus and you will want to continue it in uncommon. This
    first category is things you have to work in if at all possible.</p>

  <p>The second category is things that tie into what you are doing but
    aren't inherently part of the structure. An example of this would be a
    card that's very in-theme for the set but has no specific role. It's
    important to have a list of cards from this category because it will
    help inform you when you are making less clear-cut decisions.</p>

  <p>The last category is things that are nice in a vacuum but don't
    particularly advance any element of the set. These things should in no
    way shape what the set becomes. Too often in early design, a designer
    will warp the set to fit in elements that are essentially superfluous.
    Be careful not to do that.</p>

  <p>To recap, the first category should help shape your uncommons. The
    second category should help guide you when you are unsure which path to
    take. The third category should never guide you, as it will cause you to
    make concessions that should never be made. This isn't to say things
    from the third category cannot get into the set; they just shouldn't
    have any say in shaping it.</p>

  <p><img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_003.jpg" alt=""> <img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_002.jpg"
      alt=""></p>

  <p>Now that you have sorted through the material created while making
    commons, it's time to start on your uncommon design skeleton. You want
    to do this just as you did your commons. Keep the creature-to-spell
    ratios the same, although you have a little more wiggle room if you need
    it. In the previous versions of this column, I actually mocked up the
    design skeleton, but as I haven't actually gone through the work of
    designing the commons, it's hard to accurately reflect how my uncommon
    design skeleton would look.</p>

  <p>You will want to put the uncommon design skeleton together the same way as the common one. The biggest difference
    will be that you are not
    starting with a blank slate. Remember that the first category items will
    help you inform decisions about what uncommon needs to have. As I
    explained before, start with what is mandatory and work your way out
    from there.</p>

  <p>Here are a few very important things to understand about uncommons.</p>

  <p>First, if you think commons got cramped, you haven't seen anything yet. Uncommons are famous among <b>Magic</b>
    designers for being the pinch point of the set. They get pushed up from
    common for complexity and down from rare to matter more in Limited,
    making for a very tight fit. Uncommons do just as much work as commons
    but in 66% the space (60% in large sets). What this means is that you
    have to be very careful with every card. Cards that aren't serving a
    specific purpose will get forced out.</p>

  <p>Second, a lot of designers seem to misunderstand the impact of
    uncommons on Limited (and casual Constructed, where players don't buy a
    lot of booster packs). One of the best ways to explain this is to talk
    about a concept R&amp;D calls "as-fan." As-fan talks about the chance of
    something showing up if you opened a random booster pack. Often, the
    lead designer (and later the lead developer), will pick a level the team
    is trying to hit for a certain aspect of the set. For instance, let's
    say we decide the new mechanic gravetwist is crucial to the feel of the
    set. To make sure it has the impact needed, we might set the as-fan at
    two. This means that, on average, two cards out of every booster pack
    will be gravetwist cards.</p>

  <p>When calculating this number, uncommons are half the rate of commons.
    So let's say the math says you have to have twenty cards at common to
    hit the ratio you need. (Note that my example is on the high side for
    as-fan of a mechanic.) Every two cards at uncommon count as one common
    card. So instead of having twenty common cards, for example, you could
    have fifteen commons and ten uncommons. My point here is that, while
    commons do the lion share of your work, uncommons are still very
    relevant to ratios. (Sorry, but these "Nuts &amp; Bolts" columns can get
    a little math-y.)</p>

  <p>When putting together your uncommons, here are the major roles to keep in mind:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Filling In Your Theme</b>&mdash;Commons serve as a great
        boilerplate for your set. From them, you will start to figure out what
        your set is about. Whatever that is, it must also show up in uncommon. I
        always talk about how your theme has to show up in common. It also
        wants to be in uncommon as well.</li>
      <li><b>Upping the Size of Your Creatures and Spells&mdash;</b>I often talk
        about how commons are limited by complexity, but they are also
        restricted by size. Most colors don't have creatures with a power
        greater than 3 at common (blue usually has one and green has one or
        two). Also, common effects tend to be smaller in size. Uncommons allow
        the designer to step up the size of his creatures and spells.</li>
      <li><b>Providing Complexity&mdash;</b>When I talk about New World Order, I
        tend to stress getting complexity out of common. What I talk less about
        is making sure complexity does get put into the other rarities. NWO
        isn't about removing complexity from the game, but rather shifting where
        it sits. I firmly believe complexity serves the game, I just think it
        does so in smaller, less common chunks. Uncommon is important because
        this is where the crux of your Limited and casual Constructed complexity
        sits. When working on your uncommons, make sure you use it to add
        twists to your themes and mechanics.</li>
      <li><b>Helping Players Win&mdash;</b>One of the things you learn in all-common playtests is that <b>Magic</b>
        needs the ability for large turnovers to happen. Yes, the game can look
        like it's going your way, but to keep up the suspense there always has
        to be the chance for the opponent to come back. (This is also known as a
        "<a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/174">catch-up feature</a>.")
        This can come in the form of board sweepers that clear the battlefield.
        It can be large creatures that can turn the tide of battle. It can be
        sweeping effects that help you gain control of the game. The biggest of
        these come in rare and mythic rare, but you need to have a few in
        uncommon to make sure that every deck has some chance to turn the game
        around.</li>
      <li><b>Shaping Draft&mdash;</b>Another very important role is the one
        uncommons play in Limited. Rares and mythic rares happen at a low enough
        frequency that the designers can't use them to influence how Draft
        plays out. Uncommons, though, do show up enough that you can start
        weaving in Draft-relevant cards. One of the most frequent uses for
        uncommon is to create cards for players to draft around. Usually these
        cards are too focused for common but they work well at uncommon. The
        idea being that if a player opens this card in the first pack, that
        player can shape a draft around it. A few cards like this sprinkled
        through uncommon can add important depth to a Draft environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As you can see, there's a lot going on in a very tiny space. Just as
    making commons gets you uncommons, so will making uncommons get you
    rares.</p>

  <h3>Rares</h3>

  <p>It might not seem so at first glance, but rare is the rarity with the
    most breathing room. The main reason for this is that most of rare's
    responsibilities are providing excitement, not structure. Splashy cards
    take up less room than all the infrastructure common and uncommon need
    to make the game work.</p>

  <p><img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_006.jpg" alt=""> <img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_010.jpg"
      alt=""></p>

  <p>The advice for making rares follows much of what was said about
    uncommons. You don't need to make your rare design skeleton until
    uncommon is done. Also, as you make rare cards while filling in
    uncommon, stick them into empty slots at rare. Another reason rare has
    more freedom is that you are less locked into creature percentages.
    Every color should have both creatures and spells, but the requirements
    are much looser at rare.</p>

  <p>Does rare need any structure? A little. You will probably have at
    least two rare cycles. One following up on the themes of the set,
    usually with some new twist. The other being some splashy cycle that is
    more distant from your themes&mdash;something to excite players who might not
    be all that enamored of your main theme. Also, be aware that you might
    want a vertical cycle or two. That's when a cycle has a card in common,
    uncommon, and rare/mythic rare all in the same color.</p>

  <p>So what responsibilities do rares have?</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Make Exciting Cards&mdash;</b>Commons make sets play well, but
      rares (and mythic rares) sell sets. The role of your rares is to make
      splashy cards players want to put into their decks. There are a few ways
      to do this:

      <ol>
        <li><b>Make The Card Big&mdash;</b>I talk about how many Timmys are drawn
          to the large creature or spell. This phenomenon is not limited to
          Timmys. Everyone enjoys casting a spell that has a huge impact on the
          game. It gets the blood pumping and leads to great stories. Most of all:
          it's fun!</li>
        <li><b>Make the Card Efficient&mdash;</b>Big cards might make the splash,
          but efficient cards win games. The trick to making these cards rare is
          to pinpoint their effect. They don't do just anything, but they do the
          thing they're made to do very well.</li>
        <li><b>Make the Card Flavorful&mdash;</b>We've learned that the cards that
          preview the best are ones that drip with flavor. Players can't always
          gauge power but they can instantly gauge coolness. Make the card
          resonate and players will flock to it.</li>
        <li><b>Make the Card Unique&mdash;</b>Another surefire way to excite players is to do something they've
          never seen before. <b>Magic</b>
          is a game of exploration. Players always like to discover new things.
          Note that you shouldn't have too many totally unique rare cards in your
          set. A little goes a long way.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>Make Even Larger Creatures and Spells&mdash;</b>Just as uncommon steps
      it up from common, so too does rare step it up from uncommon. Rares are
      allowed to have giant size or huge effects. When a player plays a rare,
      the game is allowed to <i>feel </i>it.</li>
    <li><b>Win Games&mdash;</b>Uncommons help you win. Rares (and mythic rares) just win. <b>Magic</b> needs its
      bombs, and to keep from ruining Limited these bombs are kept to rare and mythic rare.</li>
    <li><b>Get Complex&mdash;The game of Magic</b> doesn't need a lot of cards
      you have to read twice to understand, but it gets to have some. These
      wordy creations live at rare. Note that we tend not to put the super
      complex cards at mythic rare because we like mythic rares to be a little
      more straightforward. That means rare is the sole home for the
      über-complicated cards.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_007.jpg" alt=""> <img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image.jpg"
      alt=""></p>

  <p>One of the best tests for a set is to let a new player look at only
    the rares and mythic rares. If that bundle of cards doesn't excite them,
    you have a lot of work ahead.</p>

  <h3>Mythic Rares</h3>

  <p>Of all the rarities, this one is the most about feel. The line I like
    is this: "Every mythic rare has to have the potential to be awesome."</p>

  <p>That means that when players see a mythic rare, they have to be able
    to dream of something wonderful happening. The best-case scenario is one
    you'd tell stories about for years to come. This doesn't mean it has to
    always happen, just that the possibility is there.</p>

  <p><img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_009.jpg" alt=""> <img src="Nuts%20&amp;%20Bolts%20-%204%20-%20Higher%20Rarities_files/Image_005.jpg"
      alt=""></p>

  <p>This description is fuzzy, I know, and what is awesome to one player
    might not be awesome to another. The goal is to make sure the card
    excites its own audience. Players who don't love flavor, for example,
    might not care for every legendary creature, but that's okay. As long as
    each card has an admirer and each player has a mythic rare to lust
    after, you're doing your job at this highest rarity.</p>

  <h3>Skeleton Complete</h3>

  <p>There's everything you need to finish filling in your skeleton.
    Please be aware that what I'm talking about here is very difficult. It
    takes a long time and many passes to fill in the skeleton, and even once
    you do your work of designing a set is just beginning.</p>
